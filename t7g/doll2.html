"What is it you want?"
</h2>
Hello there, this is just a little room. I made a little picture of me playing with myself. Also you can read the colofon here.

<p><br>
Bones and Paul van der Meer (the real-Bones) playing at the organ. You see, it's a picture of me playing with myself. What did you think?

Site by Paul van der Meer
<p><br>
But this site could never exist like it does now if it wasn't for these kind people:<br><p>
Bas Paap, for helping me with the java-applets and listening to my ramblings about this site.<p><br>
Daniel Nolan, for having the fan site that made me want to have my own, and for sending the 'making of the seventh guest' videotape.<p><br>
Brian Larsen, who helped me get in contact with Robert Hirschboeck, and for sending lots of fat man stuff.<p><br>
Johana, for that beautiful sketch of Stauf.<p><br>
Scott Clarck, for sending me the midi-collections.<p><br>
Ang, for her drawings and fan fiction<p><br>
Maul, for sending me the beta demo of the seventh guest.<p><br>
Doug Marien, for adding my sites to the official Trilobyte site, and keeping me up to date
about this. <p><br>
Jess Fernandez, for sending me pictures of the box covers of the seventh guest windows-version.<p><br>
Amandine, for her interview with Suzy Joachim.<p><br>
Rob Landeros, Graeme Devine, George Sanger and Robert Stein III for letting me interview them.<p><br>
Thanks everybody at the Staufmansion-line messageboard.<p><br>
I'd like to thank everybody who sent me an email and let me know that they appreciate the work. It makes it all worth while. Thanks.<p><br>
