Don't recognize the quote? Try the easter egg mentioned in the lab. This page contains some food for thought by Daniel Nolan, I comment on his comments. If you want to comment on my comments about his comments. 
Comment me <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040714204002/mailto:bones@famvandermeer.demon.nl">here<a/>. On with the show. Take it away Daniel...<p><br>

<td width="100%"><font size="3" face="Arial">Don't get me
        wrong....11th Hour is the best game I've ever played.
        However, when you shove a 64 minutes of film and compress
        gigabytes of information into a game, you've got to
        expect something to go wrong, and it's humorous to look
        back on some of the mistakes and misleading scenes
        featured in the game. 
        <p><font color="#FFC080" size="4" face="Arial">Did you
        ever wonder why....</font><font size="4" face="Arial"><br>
        </font></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chuck, after walking out a motel room door with a
                body wrapped in sheets flipped over his shoulder
                with blood pertruding from the wounds of the
                stabbing, went un-noticed as he stumbled through
                the car-park, to where his car was parked far
                from Robin's motel room?</li>
            <li>The head of the dog in the scene with Marie in
                the library was not actually Stauf? Evidently, it is
                the head of the motel clerk in the reception scene.(Comment Bones: Who said that it had to be Stauf's head?)</li>
            <li>The door in the Chapel that originally lead to
                the lab in the 7th Guest now leads back to Dutton's
                room, and the other door vice versa? Either they
                screwed up on the sequel, or Henry did some
                remodelling to confuse veteran players of the
                prequel.</li>
            <li>Julia Heine is the maiden of horror in Chuck Roast? Take a
                look closer, and you will see the resemblence
                between she, and her former character in The 7th
                Guest. (Comment Bones: Maybe she still is Heine, Knox made a cameo as Knox, so did Dutton)</li>
            <li>When you find an object in the house, and a video
                sequence is activated that Carl (yourself)features
                in, the scene does not take place in the room you
                are currently in? Sometimes the scenes take place
                on opposite sides of the house! (Comment Bones: Is that a crime? Some scenes happen outside the house, but you can't visit doc Thorton's office. I don't think that Trilobyte ever wanted to match scenes with the objects.)</li>
            <li>There is only one door in the bathroom, but there
                appears to be two entrances? One from Edward/Elinor's
                former room, and the other from the hallway.</li>
            <li>In the 7th Guest, the house is located on a
                grassy knoll, but in this sequel, it sits on a
                large, flat plain? (Comment Bones: Try to find a huge mansion on such a hill, I'm happy that they found something that looked remotely like the picture of the seventh guest cover.)</li>
            <li>Or perhaps, who, is the ominous skeleton in the
                bathtub? Many claim it's Martine Burden's restplace.
                Although she makes a cameo
                guest appearance as the tramp in this sequel,
                she drowned in the bath in the predecessor of
                unusual circumstances. (Comment Bones: Why, it's me. Little old Bones taking a bath. ;-)</li>
            <li>Stauf's house seems to be filled with things
                other than antique furniture? For example, you'll find
                a television in Dutton's room, a modern painting
                in the gallery, a telephone in the foyer, just to
                name a few. (Comment Bones: I don't see anything wrong with that.)</li>
            <li>Carl has a book on Oregon in a convenient
                store-file in the first
                scene in Denning's house? It is common
                knowledge that the game was shot and produced in
                the state, but why would he care about a place so
                similar to Connecticut? (no offence, Oregonians)(Comment Bones: I don't understand what Daniel means.)</li>
            <li>When Chuck dumps Jim's body in the house, apart
                from an erroneous sound effect, why it looks like
                he's shoving a thick quilt through the door?
                Whoops....I think the body must have slipped out
                when he was carrying that long wide load through
                the car park.</li><p><br>
