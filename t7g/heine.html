"Oh yes, I do appear to be free for this dance."
</h2>
This room is all about the characters in the game. Where they came from, what their heart's most secret desire was and who played them.
<p>
We kick off with the most insane character of them all, the madman himself: mister Henry Stauf.
<br>
<img alt="" img height="131" width="100" src="staufpor.gif">
His mother remains unknown, but everything indicates that she was an 'unmarried working girl'.
Our little crazyman was brought up in Vincent's Orphanage in Hell's kitchen (No really).
Henry was impossible to handle, his violence, stealing and lying became intollerable.
When Henry became an adult, he stayed at an reformatory untill one day he had enough and
started wondering. He robbed stores and lived the life of a poor crook. One day a woman came home
from quire practice (but she never got there). Stauf killed Grace Willet with a simple blow on the head with
a hammer he had stolen once. Now he was in serious trouble. That night he was hiding in the forest,
as soon as he fell asleep he had a vision, voices in his head sometimes told him to do things
and now they told him to make a toy, a doll just as he saw it in his vision. Stauf obeyed, he went
to a bar, Benny's cafe, in Harley, he traded the doll for food and shelter. The doll was a success and that night
he had another vision, another toy he was to build. This became an even bigger hit and Stauf could
give up his drifter existence. One day he opened a shop, Wonderworld and puzzles. The famous toys
sold out easily and Henry became a respected member of the community.
<p>
Then a strange virus came and killed a lot of children, all of a sudden Stauf closed his shop
and began to build a strange house, a mansion on a hill. After completion of the odd house
Stauf broke all contact with the village, until one day. 
Six invitations arrived in Harley-on-the-Hudson.
<p>
The guests, driven by their curiocity and personal problems, quickly accepted. One night, they 
all walked up the hill and entered the house. They were never seen again.
Later that night, a boy named Tad Stone entered the house. He played a game with his friends, truth
or dare, and he dared to go into the house.
<p>
Then the tale of Henry turns into a mystery, nor the six guests, nor the boy, nor Henry Stauf himself were seen again. Stauf's agent said that Stauf took a world cruise and never came back, but I know better. Henry's still here, waiting, plotting, crazy, sick and mean!
<p>

We start with my dear mister Brian Dutton. This man has been fighting his feelings all his life, when he was a little boy he saw his brother
falling through the ice, his brother drowned and Brian was the last thing he saw when he looked 
up. This image has been haunting Dutton's private little haunted house for years. The troubles he once had with his brother were gone, as easy as that. Brian saw that there was an alternative way
of solving problems, just get rid of the people who made the problem.
<p>
Dutton owned a shop in Harley-on-the-Hudson and he had sold some goods to the mysterious Henry
Stauf. Now this invitation lay on his doormat. Brain admired the way Stauf had grown wealthy and 
the way he had solved his own problems. The same success as Henry Stauf, that was Brian's wish.

Julia Heine worked at the local bank, she wasn't pleased with her life. When she looked in the
mirror she saw an old woman instead of the beautiful girl she once was. She tried to drink to
forget, but she only forgot when to work at the bank. One day she got fired, so much for the
old, drunk woman behind counter three.
<p>
Henry Stauf would see that she was special, the invitation proved it. If only she could be young
again, then she could take on the world. If only she could be young again, that was Julia's wish.

The great Hamilton Temple wasn't so great anymore, the man of magic lost his magic touch. He
had performed on all the great magic shows, but now he was rusty. His fingers couldn't do the
most simple illusion. Hamilton had pulled the last rabbit out of his hat.
<p>
That strange man who had succes with strange dolls and puzzles, would understand his problems.
After all they were both in the entertainment business. All his life Hamilton wondered if there was real magic, he knew that his magic was only trickery. But Staufs magic looked real. The invitation was the path to the solution of Hamiltons question. Is there real magic and how do I get it? That was Hamiltons wish.

The sensuous Martine Burden was back in town, the little town which she escaped when she had the
opportunity. She was the girlfriend of a rich man and disappeared.  Then she got dumped and had to come back to the town where she once won miss Harley-on-the-Hudson. That was a long time ago.
<p>
The only thing classy about Harley now was that new man, that Henry Stauf. His invitation was quickly accepted. Martine wanted that feeling again when she was treated like a royalty.
Martine wanted power.

Tad Wilson lived next door to the Mansion, sure his mother told him to stay away from that place.
But when his friends dared him to go in, Tad opened a window and entered the house.
Tad just wanted out, but he lived the same story over and over again. The only way
to stop it is to play and complete Stauf's final puzzle, the mansion itself.

Poor Edward, he had to pay his loans, but he didn't have any money left. He wanted to get out of
his life, run away. But there was Elinor, she stood by him. Although she still loved him, he stopped loving her years ago. Maybe this invitation could result in a positive number on his bank account and a new beginning.

<br>
Elinor Knox knew that there were problems concerning the financial situation of her husband.
She didn't know how serious it was, but those shady looking men coming in and asking for money wasn't a good sign. She, more than Edward, was a victim of the situation. Although she looked like a dim woman, sometimes she saw things very clear, she even saw dark things, invisible to others.
<p>
Then that strange letter came, that mister Stauf asked if they would come to his mansion. They haven't even met the man, but Edward insisted that they would go. Elinor had doubts, but she also had a wish. To start all over again...with Edward.

These are the guests, the main course so to speak. I'm not going to tell you what happened,
who won and who didn't. If you really want to find out, you have to enter the mansion yourself.
