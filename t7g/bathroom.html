"Quit horsing around!"
</h2>
In the early years of the nineties the seventh guest was a huge production in the gaming industry. A lot of things were done that were concidered to be impossible for a computergame. Full motion video, and 3d animation in such a high quality was something extraordinary. Several artistic and technological breakthroughs made this game a classic. Magic was made, but there
are things that even magic couldn't solve in the early nineties. For some reason, not manageable or not good enough dramatically, a lot of scenes and ideas never got in the final version of the game. This room will contain some fragments
of scenes that never got passed the script version 1.0, some things got back in another form, some scenes got erased from top to bottom. I will not discuss every sound or movement, the script often has lines like 'You hear the wind and laughter', if something like that is left out in the final version, then I feel that it's not worth mentioning. But if whole scenes never see the light of day, then I feel it's worth a second look. If you want to download two scenes that never made it in the game, then travel to the diningroom. First, take a look in this room. Let's go.<p><br>

The intro was a little bit longer. The narrator had more lines. The camera would move through the library, just like in the 11th hour intro. Children would sing a little song about Stauf. It's a longer version of what Stauf says when he appears in the library later on. I do not really care about these losses, they were not very good and added nothing extra to the storyline of the intro.<p><br>
You move to the front door to see the entrance of the ghosts. In the script the door fly's open. I can understand that animating 3d while playing full motion video in front of a blue screen was a little bit out of reach. So the door remained
shut in the game, this is why Temple suddenly turns around in that scene, he supposed to look at the door that would suddenly close behind him. A pity that we will never see that wonderful scene in it's full glory.<p><br>
One of the mouse hotspots after this scene in the hallway is very cool. If you were to click on the door after the scene, the door would open and you would see the exact same hallway if you walk through it. I remember a similar scene in the Nightmare on Elm street movies.<p><br>
The diningroom has a couple of missing scenes, there would be a scene with Tad hiding and a scene with some ghosts having dinner.
Very early one Trilobyte felt that the dinnerplates had to fly around in the air. We see the result in the wonderful animation where everything on the table dances in the air. However in the original version, the plates would fall into pieces. I think I like the version in the game better.<p><br>
The secret room in the doll room has a mystery attached as well. The script mentions drawings of baby's and wolves. These do not exist in the game. Also a scene called 'Wolves and children' was erased completely. The puzzle was changed later one as well. The script mentions the line 'after solving the game of the fox and the geese', but the only puzzle in the room is the one with the blocks. Interesting, huh. Children would sing another verse in the Stauf song. The mirror in the room was going to be clickable as well, it would show a picture of a demonic world.<p><br>
The kitchen would have a similar 'dance scene' like the dining room. Matches would light themselves up and dance until they
burn up. Seems pretty cool to me. Elinor had a scene here as well, she would drop a box of matches in slow motion.<p><br>
In the music room you had to hear bits of an opera. For some reason this never was featured in the music room. Also the bust
on the piano had a couple of lines as well, but they were not good enough in my opinion and probably Trilobyte agreed with me.<p><br>
The library has a lot of scenes that never got completed. Very interesting stuff. Temple had to walk along the bookshelves
and talk about optical illusions. He is the one who sees the mysterious clouds behind the glass door. In the game you don't see him anywhere when it happens. Again, I think that combining 3d animation and video wasn't manageable here. Temple has a 
line later on in the library where all the guests meet, he says 'I can't describe what I saw, why none of you would ever believe me'. Now we know what he was talking about, more about that library scene later on. The script also writes about books that can be read. One is about chess, one about ghost and one features the solutions of the puzzles, that last book sounds familiar doesn't it? The room also had a man in a red robe, just walking around with a book in his hand. The players
of the 11th hour might remember a scene with a man in a robe in the library with a book. That's Dutton in the 11th hour.
Played by a different actor, but it was meant to be Dutton. So that scene just got moved to another game!<p><br>

There isn't a scene in the basement, but there should have been one. One with Elinor Knox, she would have some sort of nightmare. The walls would be bloody and something tried to grab her. She would cry and yell until Edward Knox opens the kitchen door and says 'Elinor, damn it, stop it! Why are you crying?'. She tells about this in the library scene, 'Well, I saw blood.' Nobody takes her serious.<p><br>
Tad had another scene in the crypt, when he tries to hide there, the coffins would open and the skeleton try to grab him.
Again too difficult to create in '91. <p><br>
The chapel had lots of scenes that were cut. On entrance you would hear a choir sing Mystere fara Astaroth (the opening track of the audio cd from the seventh guest). There is one scene with Dutton that has disappeared completely, the script just says
scene 9.2 Dutton, this scene is removed. Also when Stauf talks with Dutton there should have been monks in robes. If you would click on the gargoyles they would flap their wings. I'm glad this next bit was cut. If you open the confession booth, you see bodyparts on the wall and a head on the floor, the head would say 'Could you scratch my nose, I've got a terrible itch'. That sounds rather lame in my humble opinion.<p><br>
The hallway upstairs had some unusual scenes too. We all know the lady in white, but there were more scenes like that. The
script talks about a hovering gown. Also sometimes all the doors would go open and shut for no reason. The player had some
lines too, nothing important and I didn't like the player talking much anyway. There was one rather cool thing, sometimes all
the lights would go out, then you would see a green light coming from below the door leading to the attic.<p><br>
In the Knox room there was a big scene planned too, Elinor would have a conversation with a handsome man, the man would start to kiss her. She would try to stop him, then he would change into Stauf. My next comment is about one of the endings in the 11th hour, so you might want to skip this if you haven't seen it yet...If you choose Marie as your ending in the 11th hour, you know that she changes into Stauf as she/he sits on Carl Denning. Sort of the same theme. <p><br>
Already a lot happens in Burdens room, but there was one big scene that didn't made the cut. You would see a man in a uniform 
coming in the room. With every step he makes wounds appear and after a couple of steps he's just walking cannon fodder. Probably too expensive to film that scene in a convincing way.<p><br>
Dollroom:  If you go to the nursery, you cross a small stage and leave through the little door. On that stage there supposed to be a short scene by a couple of dolls. It's a short violent swordfight. For some reason it never got in the final script.<p><br>
In the gallery a scene was completely erased called 'The canvas'. But there is a scene where the painting with the girl on
the horse. Maybe the scene got inserted later on. There is also a version of the painting of the boy. In the game it opens
his mouth and fangs appear. In the script the boy turns into a similar vampire and fly's around in the gallery. A little
to complicated, even for today's standards. Noticeable is that the scene with Staufs painting isn't mentioned, probably
a scene that was added later.<p><br>
The lab has got a scene that was missing, but another that took it's place. Originaly, there was a refridgerator that could
be opened. A talking head would be inside. But the scene you see in the lab, the man looking for his brain, is mentioned. My guess is that the man got in the place of the head.<p><br>
In Temple's room the script describes a ceilingfan. Click on it and you will see a magician dangling on a rope. The fan slowly turns around and starts talking about a rope trick that he doesn't fully understand yet. In the end you see that his
head is just bones with empty sockets. A difficult scene to make and not very good. Trilobyte wisely dropped the scene.<p><br>
Finally the attic had it's share of scenes too, remember the scene where you see Elinor's head? The original scene featured Elinor as some sort marionet. Cooler, but again much harder to create, and this way the idea remained the same. There are scenes with the Player and Tad, both talk about that they 'don't understand' and that 'this has happened before and it's happening now'. Not very clear dialogues there. Toys move if you click on them, attempts by Stauf to make living toys.
There is also a scene where suddenly a door appears. The door opens and a random guest runs by, sounded very silly to me.
A lot of work for a scene that didn't make sense, even in the mansion. A lot of bones turn into a skeleton after you click on them, the skeleton says 'O, I'm late, I do hope mister Stauf doesn't mind...' not a cool one-liner. This scene didn't make it, but another skeleton-scene not mentioned in the script did. It's the animation where a chest opens and a skeleton comes out, he points to the second part of the attic and falls apart. A much better scene me thinks.<p><br>

Almost done now, the second part of the attic: It looks like the exact same scene as in the game, but when Tad tries to get
away from Stauf they both disappear and the attic is empty. Tentacles come from the glowing walls and you hear Tad shouting.
The player runs out of the second part and the door closes, you stand in front of the mirror again. If you enter the attic again, the same scene with Stauf, Tad and Heine plays again. This time the scene is just like in the game. And that's the end of that chapter.
