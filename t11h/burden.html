This is the complete 11'th hour script. I didn't write it myself, but I found it

        State police have called off the intense search for
        producer Robin Morales of television's &quot;Case
        Unsolved&quot;. Morales was researching a story about the
        famed haunted house in the small town of
        Harley-on-Hudson, the abandoned mansion of Henry Stauf.
        Police have expressed concern that Morales disappearance
        may be connected to a series of killings that have
        plagued the Hudson Valley this year. So far, four women
        and three men have been victims fitting a pattern of
        homicide, and several others are missing. Robin Morales
        has been missing for more than three weeks and seems to
        have vanished without a trace. She's the producer for the
        very popular and flamboyant &quot;Case Unsolved&quot;
        reporter, Carl Denning. Denning is said to be in
        seclusion in his country home, in Connecticut, since
        Morales' disappearance. It's rumoured that the two became
        romantically involved while working.....</font></a><p><a name="0"><font color="#E5A666" size="3" face="Arial"><br>

        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I was just...<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> I know what you were doing. You
        were looking for the scene of a crime. You found it, you
        did good. For a TV person, I'm impressed.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Robin Morales.<br>

        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> Well, there's me, and one other guy
        and he's the co-chief, and that's pretty much the whole
        damn force. So what are you doing looking at blood on the
        rocks, Robin?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I'm researching a story. I work
        for....<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> I know, I know. Case Unsolved. But
        I understood you were doing a story on the haunted house?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I am, but I think there's a
        connection. I mean, with all the stories of death and disappearance,
        I think they might be all related. Don't you think they
        might be related?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> No I don't.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Why not?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> Because, the haunted house is a
        ghost story, and I don't believe in ghosts. But this is
        the real thing. This is murder, Robin. No ghost spilled
        that blood. And whoever it was hasn't been caught, so I
        don't think it's safe for you to be wandering around in
        the woods.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I can take care of myself.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> That may be, but you're running an
        unnecessary risk. Stick to the ghost story.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> What do you think happened to
        Eileen Wiley's hand?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> It got bit off by a dog.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Do you really believe that?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> Sure I do.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Well, I don't. I mean, how could
        a dog do that.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> Probably one of those damn
        rot-wheelers or something.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Oh, come on chief. Were there any
        other bite marks on her? Did anyone find the dog? Did
        anyone find the hand?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> I don't know, it was before my
        time. You'd have to ask Doc Thorton, he's the one that
        sewed her up.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Is he still around?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> Barely. Doc's getting there, but
        he's still breathing. Come on, I'll drive you by. You can
        follow me in that snazzy little car.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Okay, Chief.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM:</strong> Call me Jim. It's kind of
        embarrassing being called &quot;Chief&quot; when there's
        nobody to be chief over.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Okay, Jim.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>JIM: </strong>You know, you're not exactly
        dressed for trumping around in the woods. Maybe we should
        get you some boots. Maybe there's a TV producer designer

        <strong>MARIE:</strong> If he&#146;s
        &#147;available&#148;. Are you a patient of his?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> No, I.....<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MARIE:</strong> Fill this out.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Actually, I&#146;m not here as a
        patient. I&#146;m a producer of Case Unsolved. I&#146;d
        like to interview him.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MARIE:</strong> What do you want to interview him
        for?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I need to discuss that with Dr
        Thorton.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MARIE: </strong>Hey, Doc. You awake?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> (coughing) Yes, of course.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MARIE:</strong> Someone here from a TV show. Says
        she wants to interview you.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> Well, send her in, Marie.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Thankyou.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MARIE:</strong> Sure.<br>

        </font></a><a name="10"><font color="#E5A666" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>ROBIN:</strong> Hello, Doctor
        Thorton. Robin Morales, I&#146;m a producer of Case
        Unsolved.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> What can I do for you, Robin?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I&#146;m researching a story on
        the Stauf mansion.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> Oh?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I&#146;m trying to follow a
        storyline involving Eileen Wiley. The legend, myth, or story.
        It seems that she&#146;s the only one who&#146;s survived
        an encounter with the mansion. Anyone else has either
        died or disappeared.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC: </strong>A lot of stories about that old
        house.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I was told that you treated her
        the night she lost her hand.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> Yes, that's true. I did.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> What do you think happened to her
        hand?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> It was bitten off by a dog,
        everybody knows that.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> So I&#146;ve heard. But did it
        really look like a dog did it?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> I don&#146;t know. Never saw a hand
        bitten off by a dog before. Never even heard of such as
        thing. Eileen is kind of unique that way. She&#146;s a
        celebrity around these parts because of it.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> But really, Doctor. What did it
        look like to you?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> Robin it was a mess! A bloody mess!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I just think that there&#146;s
        more to this Eileen Wiley thing than meets the eye.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> Have you tried talking to Eileen?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Yes, but I didn&#146;t get very
        far.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC: </strong>It was quite a traumatic time for
        her.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I know, I hate to be the one to
        bring it back up to her. It&#146;s just that, she&#146;s
        the only one who&#146;s had any experience with the
        mansion who&#146;s lived to tell about it.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> She&#146;s not the only one.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> How do you mean?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> Samantha Ford.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Who&#146;s she?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> The one that nobody talks about.
        She was there that night with Eileen. The two of them
        snuck into the grounds and broke into the house together.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Why wasn&#146;t she mentioned in
        any of the articles?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DOC:</strong> Her family had a lot of influence.
        Kept her out of it. But if you think Eileen&#146;s hand is
        a mystery, well, Samantha has been paralysed from the
        waste down and confined to a wheelchair ever since that
        night.<br>
