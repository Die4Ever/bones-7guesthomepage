  Okay, what's the scoop? What can you tell me about the seventh guest 3. Please, 
  hold your horses and quit horsing around. There have been a couple of seventh 
  guest 3 projects. The screenshots you see below are from The seventh guest 3 
  by Trilobyte. It's a project that Graeme Devine started. It was in the final 
  days of the company. You can consider it a last attempt to keep Trilobyte alive. 
  What I know is that Tad the boy in the seventh guest was to play a very big 
  part. 'The whole city forgot the story about the house, except a man called 
  Tad'. <br>There is a storyboard of the intro available. You can check it out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040715175025/http://homepage.mac.com/kennash/nash01/extras.html" target="new">here</a>. 
That's all I know about Trilobyte's Seventh guest 3. These screenshots 
  below are according to Gamespot from the third installment, Robert Stein III 
  thinks that they're from a version of the seventh guest for the Genesis, a version 
  that never got finished.

<p><br>
  But there's more. Virgin, the publisher of the seventh guest had some rights 
  and secretly they were trying to make a part three on their own. A project called 
  'The thirteenth warrior (or soul I'm not sure) it was an assignment from Virgin 
  to a company called 'Legend software'. They made it based on the Unreal engine. 
  For some reason it never got far. This information was confirmed by the president 
  of 'Legend Software'.<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>But the most promising 'project' is called 'the Collector' . Rob Landeros, 
  the designer who left Trilobyte a couple of years earlier has a lot of rights 
  to the seventh guest and the 11th hour. Now he's working on the design for the 
  third installment. Lunny Interactive, a new company, will be developing the 
  game once Landeros has found full funding for it. For now it's the best chance 
  the world has for a third installment. For more information check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040715175025/http://www.famvandermeer.demon.nl/">The Collector Fansite</a>.
