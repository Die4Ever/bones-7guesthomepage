<h2>"You'd better...hide!" </h2>Games have to be programmed for all kinds of 
systems. One soundcard is very different from the other. Sometimes you start a 
game and it just doesn't work properly. Luckily I never had that problem with 
the 11th hour, but unfortunately other people had. So here you can find some 
troubleshooting from Virgin.

    <td><b><font class="mainfont" face="Arial" size="2">11th 
      Hour</font></b><br><font class="mainfont" face="Arial" size="2"><b>FREQUENTLY 
      ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)</b><br><br>Q. Whenever I try to run the game all I 
      receive is an error stating 'your<br>system does not have a linear frame 
      buffer'. What does this mean?<br><br>A. This is caused by your video card 
      and can be cured in two ways. The first is to enter the UVCONFIG program 
      within the C:\GAMES\11H directory and mark the 'disable the linear frame 
      buffer' setting. Once done click on O.K and try to run the game again. The 
      second cure is to re-insert the EMM386 line into yourConfig.sys file with 
      the NOEMS switch. For further information on this, pleaserefer to the boot 
      disk information below.<br><br>Q. I have Windows '95 and the game does not 
      run Automatically as stated in the manual. Why?<br><br>A. Our apologies 
      here, this was a mis-print. Unfortunately the game will not run directly 
      under Windows 95. We suggest that you shut the computer down and run the 
      game in your DOS-MODE.<br><br>Q. Is there a brightness control, as stated 
      in the manual?<br><br>A. No. This feature was removed before the game was 
      released.<br><br>Q. I am having problems with my video card and the game 
      reports back with <br>error concerning VESA compatibility. Why is 
      this..?<br><br>A. To work with the wide variety of video cards on the 
      market, The 11th Hour uses a universal VESA driver known as UniVBE, by 
      SciTech Software. This VESA driver supports most video cards. There are a 
      few (primarily very new cards) that are not yet supported. Errors such as 
      'Unable to set requested graphics mode' indicate that UniVBE was unable to 
      recognise your video card. If UniVBE does not support your video card, ask 
      your video card manufacturer for a driver that brings your video card up 
      to the VESA 2.0 compatibility standard. You may also check with SciTech 
      Software for UniVBE updates. Their web page is: http://www.scitechsoft.com 
      Essentially, it is best to call our Customer Services department with 
      information concerning your particular video card including it's make and 
      chip-set.<br><br><b>Here are some of the known error messages that this 
      game may produce...</b><br><br>Problem: 'Bad command or filename' or 
      'Unable to read drive x:'<br><br>Solution: If you are using a CD changer, 
      put an 11th Hour CD into each ofthe available drives before installing the 
      game. Because the game checks all available CD-ROM drives when you start 
      the game to see how many 11th Hour discs are available, you should have a 
      CD in each drive when you type GO.<br><br>Problem: 'Unknown pixel depth, 
      corrupt groovie2.ini file'<br><br>Solution: This can occur if you aborted 
      the installation process before it had completed. Delete the game from 
      your hard drive and reinstall.<br><br>Problem: 'Unable to write to open 
      driver for writing'<br><br>Solution: This can occur if you aborted the 
      installation process before it had completed. Delete the game from your 
      hard drive and reinstall.<br><br>Problem: 'Pointing device cannot be 
      found.'<br><br>Solution: This games requires a mouse driver to be loaded 
      before it will run. You will need to locate and load your DOS mouse driver 
      before running the game. Contact your computer or mouse manufacturer for 
      help loading a DOS-based mouse driver.<br><br>Problem: 'Your configuration 
      has been set to 8-bit to allow safe booting.'<br><br>Solution: Contact our 
      Customer Services department with the specific information concerning your 
      video/display card and we will try to provide you with parameters under 
      which the game will work.<br><br>Problem: 'Out of 
      memory.'<br><br>Solution: Go to a C:\&gt; prompt and type MEM. Make sure 
      that you have at least 400K of free conventional memory. Also check the 
      amount of free extended memory. <br><br>Problem: 'Invalid JPEG Structure,' 
      'Could not open...,' or any other read-type error that aborts the 
      game.<br><br>Solution: The game was unable to read a file properly. You 
      will probably <br>need to increase the number of FILES in your CONFIG.SYS. 
      To change this, <br>do the following: go to a C:\&gt; prompt.Type EDIT 
      CONFIG.SYS. Look for a line that reads FILES=xx. If the value (xx) is less 
      than 80, change it to 80. If this line does not exist, add it. Save the 
      changes and then reboot your machine so that this change will take effect.
