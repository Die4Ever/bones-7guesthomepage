This bit is from a site dedicated to Robert:<br><p>

"Mr. Hirschboeck was raised in Wisconsin and California and holds degrees
from the University of California, Berkeley and Southern Oregon State
College. Among his list of credits are seasons with the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival, Berkeley Repertory Theater, the Colorado 
Shakespeare Festival, and the San Jose Repertory companies.  
Hirschboeck is also a founding partner and Artistic Director for the 
Stage Door Theatre in Boulder, Colorado and lives with costume 
designer, Deb Dryden, and Sophie the dog in Ashland, Oregon. "<br><p>
<p><br>Here is what he has to say about the role:<br>
"Henry Stauf is deliciously evil. He can give you everything and he knows what's in your soul.<br>
He's your best and worst nightmare. And he'll get you everytime."<br>
Robert has this to say about acting in front of a blue screen:<br>
"You have to find a balance between what is real and something that is abstract."<br>
<p><br>
Here is something really special, an article written Robert himself about Stauf, and who can explain Stauf better than
his alter-ego? Here it is:<br><p>

COMPUTER GAMING AND THE FAUSTIAN BARGAIN<br>
"...What Can My House Give You?"<br>
By Rob Hirschboeck - AKA - HENRY STAUF<br><p>

My dear Player, do come in;  Henry Stauf here at your service.  Delighted<br>
you've "Come Back."  I too have been waiting...  There is something you<br>
deeply desire;  some gossamer dream that brings you to my lonely abode?  You<br>
needn't be shy.  How can My House SERVE YOU, and what shall YOU GIVE IN<br>
RETURN?<br>
<p>
*<br>
It is early January 1992.  The local talent broker calls about "A screen<br>
test for the GUESTS project"?  Is this THE BIG TIME calling?  Decidedly Not!<br>
 This is Medford Oregon; population 50,000 - about 800 miles and a quantum<br>
reality from THE BIG TIME.  We are talking a "cattle call" for extras, maybe<br>
a random line in some made for T.V. movie needing river footage in Oregon's<br>
outback.  "GUESTS" ?   Maybe it's a travelogue for tourists.  Most likely,<br>
drippy hours waiting in the morning wet for some inflated director's<br>
assistant to shout, "Environment!"  (The que for extras to supply background<br>
for the THE REAL TALENT shipped up from THE BIG TIME with credits on some<br>
afternoon soap.) <br><p>

I nearly don't go.  I read a play I've been hired to direct for a local High<br>
School.  I get off on the kids innate creativity, and the underfunded<br>
district values my Shakespeare and repertory  background.  The minimal pay,<br>
more than for extra work, might replace my archaic APPLE II PLUS.  It's<br>
about time I got "computer literate"!<br>
<p>
At the last minute curiosity gets me.  At least I'll find out about the<br>
local film shoot.  It's the last 1/2 hour of casting call.  I'm handed<br>
"sides" to study, and come up with characters off the top of my head.  The<br>
lines are strange.  If "GUESTS " is for tourists, it's the travelogue from<br>
hell.  I click off the method training and try my lines before a bathroom<br>
mirror.  What can I come up with that 50 other actors haven't done already? <br>
<p>

"Mr. Hirschboeck.  Please state your name for the camera and ahh... why<br>
don't you try this demented toymaker guy,... HENRY STAUF."<br>
<p>
**<br>
In spring of 1992 Trilobyte is matchbox size.  The company lives in one<br>
oblong brick room with six computer stations above a tavern in Jacksonville,<br>
Oregon.  (Gold was once discovered in Jacksonville and avaricious seekers<br>
tore up a Virgin landscape trying to extract it.)  At Trilobyte, they are<br>
seekers to be sure, but only tangentially avaricious.  I meet the whole<br>
company in five handshakes.  Rob Landeros the artistic designer, and Graeme<br>
Devine the crown (and clown) prince of programmers are as unlikely a pair of<br>
corporate tycoons as Wayne &amp; Garth.  But they have made good!  Scan in a<br>
mental shot of John Lennon; morph on horn rimmed glasses, braces and a<br>
varsity jacket with Donald Duck on it and you have Graeme Devine.  Rob looks<br>
a bit more conventional, but spent much of the 70's selling visionary art<br>
pieces out of his VW Bus at craft fairs.  He's got short hair now.  Both are<br>
magicians, and their 1992 release of 7TH GUEST will turn the gaming world on<br>
it's ear.   <br><p>

I am an actor; an unknown life-form component in this world of graphic<br>
wizardry and megabytes.  They suspect I may be of some mysterious value to<br>
the project, at least until they can digitize something better.  Rob &amp;<br>
Graeme are nice guys, but they just might do that.  Computer images take<br>
light years to compress, but actors have egos and agents, and sometimes want<br>
credit, creative input, or profit shares.  "Can't we just make one?", I<br>
imagine them thinking...<br>
<p>
Graphics genius Robert Stein, tours me through the mansion he has created. <br>
I am the soul of his antiquated Victorian; the haunt of the house, Henry<br>
Stauf, the "Star".  But I feel like a being lifted from multi-dimensional<br>
reality into a flat world where someone has drawn a circle around me. <br>
Flatworld is inescapable.  (Try it.  This is the interactive part:  draw a<br>
stick figure on paper, then scribe a ring around him.  Presto.  Trapped in<br>
two dimensions!)  Robert escorts me to a portrait of myself (Stauf) in one<br>
of his elaborately rendered rooms.  My face is divided by colors like a<br>
Rubic's cube into nine puzzle pieces.  To win this game the player must<br>
solve my face.  "This is going to make you famous", he says.  Parts of my<br>
face turn from flesh tone to red, and then to Green.  ($$$)  All I've<br>
dreamed flashes before my eyes.<br>
<p>
***<br>
Weeks later I have entirely forgotten the audition.  Deborah Mason calls. <br>
She is video director/producer/and "Martine Burden" rolled into one.  She<br>
offers 2 1/2 days of shooting at a flat fee; about $750.  No negotiating. <br>
The location is the conference room above a Medford restaurant where I<br>
auditioned.   A space bigger than a breadbox, where a cast and crew about<br>
sixteen snugly  fit.   Blue paper covers the back wall and floor.  In one of<br>
two video monitors a mutantly made up Rob Hirschboeck is enveloped in BLUE. <br>
But in the instant scenario of the graphics monitor I can see HENRY STAUF<br>
hovering in an arcane Library, or clubing a innocent in a forrested park;<br>
stealing away like Snidley Whiplash.  The actors are in 20's stock costumes<br>
suitable for refugees from the board game CLUE.  Ferreting out the story<br>
line is  a guessing game.  "Is this about Mr. Plum in the Nursery with the<br>
letter opener, or Mrs. Mustard in the library with the meat cleaver?"  None<br>
of us really know.  Michael Picaro, the original "Dutton", tells me he has<br>
died four times that day all in different rooms.  I create a character half<br>
Vincent Price, half Captain Hook and poor over my "script" searching for<br>
playable continuity, until I am told to, "Just throw your tongue out like it<br>
it's a lasso; we'll do the rest with graphics!" "Right!" I say, "Do you want<br>
that with feeling?"<br>
<p>
****            <br>
An actor's value is in life experience; where else can character come from<br>
but out of this body.  It is January 1995 at the Consumer Electronics Show<br>
in Las Vegas, and I am having an experience!  7TH GUEST has sold over 1.7<br>
million units internationally, and THE 11TH HOUR is finally near release.  I<br>
am "THE STAR" of the best selling CD-ROM in the industry's brief history,<br>
and signing more photographs than Basketballer Larry Bird.  There is one<br>
ironic twist, however; <br>
part of a BARGAIN Henry Stauf would love: <br>
<p>
     "And what can I do for you Mr. Hirschboeck?<br>
      What is your heart's most secret desire?<br>
      You may walkout of MY HOUSE<br>
      With your every wish granted..."<br>
<p>
     "There is just this one little PUZZLE to solve...<br>
 <p>
 NOBODY KNOWS WHOOOO YOOOOU ARE!"<br>
<p>
(Henry's insane laughter retreats up the musty stairwell....)<br>
<p>
*****<br>
Even after release, 7th Guest remains a mystery to me.  Friends on the<br>
street tell of playing my face for upwards of 60 hours.  As a substitute<br>
teacher I begin to have celebrity status; the taunt, "Come baaaaccck!"<br>
echo's after me in student filled corridors.  My teenage nephew redeems me<br>
from amoeboid to cult status.  <br>
My uncredited picture in garish negative is seen world wide on the box. <br>
Still, in Spring of '93 when I am called to ...audition... for the sequel,<br>
I've not played the game. <br>
70 years into the future, what was CLUE in Gothic horror becomes David Lynch<br>
meets Melrose Place.  In the story's full 60 minute drama Stauf must<br>
believably evolve from ghoulish slapstick to insidious evil, from comedic<br>
spook to Hannable Lector. <br>
<p>
There is something  delightful about portraying EVIL.  Those unsightly<br>
personas closeted in the universal subconscious; (that self could manifest<br>
either saint or serial killer), are allowed to dress up and cavort in public<br>
with no harm done.  <br>
Henry Stauf needn't ever enter real life, but guised even as cartoon<br>
character, or game-show host of "Let's Make A Real Deal", he is my best and<br>
worst nightmare come to the party.   His pleasure, like "honest" Iago's in<br>
Shakespeare's Othello, is in the player's or other character's participation<br>
in their own demise.   As an actor I create from a palette of personas;<br>
Henry has the honesty of Iago, the sensuality of de Sade, the arrogance of<br>
William F. Buckley, the "relish" of Hannible "The Cannibal".   <br>
But an actor's task is not so much in finding "who", as in knowing<br>
intention; "what" the character wants.   As Henry, I want you to indulge<br>
your self in the weakness that will destroy you.  If some malignant thing,<br>
lust or greed has taken sprout at your core the House wants to feed on<br>
it.... Henry simply likes to "toy" with the food.  <br>
It is a curiosity of acting that roles one plays, like drawing a card from<br>
the Tarot, seem always to represent the personal issue needing reflection. <br>
Multimedia persona STAUF not only asks what the player wants, he forces me<br>
to consider what it is that I want!   <br>
<p>
Some of the old Guests are back in cameo appearances.  (Larry Rhomer's<br>
exploding head scene as "Edward Knox" should get some kind of "Best Byte"<br>
award for nice work)  The predominantly new cast includes Doug O'Keefe and<br>
Suzy Joachim (Carl &amp; Robin) from Canada,  Michelle Gaudreau (Marie) from<br>
Portland, but most are drawn from the local talent pool.  Marco Baricelli<br>
(the Sheriff) is playing Richard III at OSF, Francis King (Samantha), Mark<br>
Padget (Chuck), Holy Weber (Eileen of the severed hand), Brad Whitmore (the<br>
motel clerk), and others perform regularly throughout the region.  (For<br>
those engaged in the media wide "Star Power" debate, you'll look hard to<br>
find a more solid performance than Francis King's "Samantha Ford" any where<br>
on CD-ROM.  For all its technical wizardry, the game environment is not<br>
graphics alone, and the industry should begin to give some credit to it's<br>
flagship performances.  Star Power will undoubtedly come but it's still<br>
gonna be awhile before Myrle and Jack sign on.  Meanwhile, recognition of<br>
excellent performances is both deserved, and also a smart investment.)<br>
<br><p>
David Wheeler directs us through a horrendous 10 day shoot on location all<br>
over the Rogue Valley.  We do some drippy hours in the morning wet.  But the<br>
food is good.  Prop barbecued ribs meant to indicate Stauf's House has just<br>
devoured someone are served at dinner break.  This evident sense of humor<br>
sustains 18 hour days.  The crew is kept from napping on set by Michelle's<br>
perpetual costuming; mostly heels and garter belts.  It's a happy if tired<br>
group, and we feel like family (somewhat deranged) by shoots end.  At home I<br>
am glad to shower off Henry Stauf.  Henry makes your skin crawl after<br>
awhile.  It's in the contract.  I address Rob &amp; Graeme directly about an<br>
actors' share of profits given the revenue we know Guest generated.  They<br>
are receptive, and come up with a residual plan on 11th Hour based on a<br>
fraction of proceeds.  It's modest but, <br>
"A Real Deal" they were not required to do. It's good to work for artists!<br>
                    <p>
******<br>
Fall 1995.  We are a long way from the day Trilobyte could be housed  above<br>
a tavern, or when for SAG minimums, a spirited collection of "no names"<br>
playfully created the original GUESTS before a single fixed camera and a<br>
"blue screen" of frequently torn construction paper. Trilobyte has outgrown<br>
two buildings expanding its creative staff from six to sixtyplus.  The<br>
"green screen" work allowing actors to realistically inhabit a graphic<br>
environment, is now done on cavernous sound stages with full staff, multiple<br>
cameras, and professional crew.<br>
<p>

(SIDEBAR:)  <br>
An aside about the "difficulties" of acting in the mysterious green or blue<br>
screen setting. - It's no different than working in an empty rehearsal hall<br>
with walls and furniture taped out so you don"t walk through them.  The<br>
actors must still create an illusion of reality out of imagination, and<br>
relationship.  It's what we do!  The hardest aspect  for multimedia actors<br>
is frequently not knowing the context of their performances.  You don't know<br>
how or where it fits into the game, or sometimes even what the game is. <br>
Most multimedia actors I know do not own CD platforms.  You "GUEST" it...! <br>
While trying to hold fast to the latest in rocket machines propelling me<br>
towards multimedia heaven, I typed this article on my old APPLE II PLUS.<br>
<p>
(Continued)  NOW THIS IS THE BIG TIME.  Much to Rob &amp; Graeme's credit (and<br>
style) Trilobyte has retained much of the feel of a Mom &amp; Pop store, a sort<br>
of Cyber-Rom Ben &amp; Jerry's.  Colorful characters; artists, long haired<br>
programming wizards, production people in Levied splendor, writers, even<br>
actors, (still an enigma), mix casually with sharkskin marketing types in<br>
the user friendly if frequently hectic three story office matrix.  There is<br>
an aura of family loyalty and the buzz of creativity, artistic ideas<br>
bantered about in hallways, project possibilities, and technologic<br>
breakthroughs on the verge.  Creative and cozy, yes!  Still, make no<br>
mistake, THIS IS THE BIG TIME NOW, a corporate endeavor with millions at<br>
stake and all the implications and pressures of budgets and bottom lines. <br>
There are unions organizing it, royalties to standardize, actor's agents,<br>
lawyers, contracts, and competitors to keep at bay with a product that will<br>
SELL.  Investors and Consumers are the Rulers of Supply and Demand and even<br>
a million seller does not a company secure.<br>
<p>
The true toymaker, Graeme Devine, keeps his office door closed now, or<br>
wanders the carpeted corridors in his duck jacket puzzling , "...where did<br>
all these people came from..."  They are the GUESTS, Graeme.  And they are<br>
all just part of the BARGAIN...<br>
<p>
*******<br>
<p>
And now dear Player, what was it again that you wanted  in exchange for your<br>
life's experience?  Amusement? Entertainment?  - Ahhh... "Too WIN"?  Oh,<br>
you'll beat me again...EVENTUALLY, and than after a time I'll be back. <br>
Simple consumer demographics!  Right now, however, The HOUSE is having all<br>
the fun! - The creativity, the challenge, the risk, the Money!  And you've<br>
invested months here with me in Flatworld!  Your mind's been engaged, and<br>
you've been impressed with the graphics...  <br>
<p>
"Come on, Player, the clock is ticking!"  This is the "REAL DEAL!" <br>
Corporate pressures are being brought upon THE HOUSE to make the player the<br>
Consumed.  To THE MONEY it's just another medium; a spectator sport, about<br>
as inter-active as voting.  Puzzle over it.  These techno wizards are<br>
heartful people who crave an artful challenge beyond the bottom line. <br>
Perhaps they could grant you some greater part in the creativity; perhaps<br>
permit you to aquire tools in your game choices, with which to synthesize <br>
A PLAYER GENERATED PRODUCT before you could leave MY HOUSE - A WINNER! <br>
<p>
Inter-Active should have an INNER ACTOR!  But you must ask for it! If Supply<br>
&amp; Demand now rule, Y0U  must strike the "REAL DEAL" a better BARGAIN with<br>
the toymaker before signing your blood to the bottom line...It's your<br>
INVESTMENT.  After all, I only want to trade trinkets of the intellect<br>
against the living sensuality of your Soul.  ...And THE HOUSE?  <br>
<p>
"IT JUST WANTS TO BE FED!"<br>
<p>
Think it over.  "Maybe solitaire IS a better game for you!"<br>
In any case, I'll await your return in delicious  anticipation.<br>
<br><p>
Henry Stauf<br>
