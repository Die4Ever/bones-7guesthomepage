"These paintings, products of a sick mind."
</h2>
What could be more appropriate to put in the gallery then a gallery? But beware, these pictures show a lot of the storyline.
So if you haven't seen them yet and you want to keep it that way until you've seen them in the game, then I suggest that you
come back later.<p><br>

<img alt="" img src="entry5.jpg"><br>
Graeme Devine's favorite scene and it's easy to see why. All the guests make their debut in the house. All except one. This great scene set the mood and introduced the player to the characters and the mansion. In my opinion the most smooth and elegant way of getting into a game.<p><br>


<img alt="" img src="door.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="cake.jpg"><br>
<img alt="" img src="can.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="bishop.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="cryptpuz.jpg"><br>
The five most beautifully animated puzzles. The spectacular frontdoor. The icing beauty of the cake. The 'can you believe it' can puzzle in the kitchen. The elegant floorbishops and the casket crammed crypt.<p><br>

<img alt="" img src="hands.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="clown.jpg"><br>
<img alt="" img src="skeleton.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="knives.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="pianohands.jpg"><br>
Five of the best stand-alone scenes. Who didn't fell of their seat when they saw the hands in the painting? Or the clown? The skeleton and the flying cutlery-scene on the other hand, made you speech- and motionless. Did you ever see anything like that in a game before? Nothing compared to it. And last but not least. The pianohands, was it funny or scary? Sort of in the middle, but very seventh guestisch.<p><br>

<img alt="" img src="tad1.jpg"><br>
<img alt="" img src="tad4.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="tad3.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="tad5.jpg"><br>
A short summary of the seventh guest himself. Enter through the window. But no exit through the door. Dutton finds two obstacles on his road to the finish. Hamilton saves Tad from Martine and her pet Edward. Heine is the one who will bring Tad before Stauf.<p><br>


<img alt="" img src="heinewish.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="soup.jpg"><br>
<img alt="" img src="dutst.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="hamel.jpg">
<img alt="" img src="hamtad.jpg"><br>
Scenes that drove the storyline. Heine and Heine. Stauf cleverly disguised as soup and Heine. Dutton realises that leaving Stauf at the altar would be deadly. Hamilton and Elinor find out what Stauf's secret is. Hamilton finds out who the main prize is.<p><br>

The endsequence: Heine gets what she deserves, lot's of green stuff. Stauf goes to someplace hot and Tad finally sees the light.<p><br>
