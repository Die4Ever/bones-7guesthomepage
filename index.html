I found this cool old website for The 7th Guest, The 11th Hour, and T7G3: The Collector. The author is "Bones the Caretaker".
<br/>
The section of the website for The Collector says "Copyright site-design and written content by Paul van der Meer 2003".
<br/>
Wait a minute, I know that name! Paul van der Meer is the director of The 7th Guest VR and Project Lead at Vertigo Games!
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how old this website is, but it doesn't exist anymore. Luckily the Wayback Machine captured most of it (missing a bunch of images). Unfortunately the Wayback Machine is a little slow, so navigating around the house in this way is a bit of a pain, and the split screen isn't sized properly for modern screens.
<br/>
So I made this tweaked version that can be easily self-hosted or downloaded, and it runs much faster.
<br/>
<h1>For the T7G page, start <a href="t7g/open.html">with the t7g/open.html file</a></h1>
<br/>
<h2>If you're lazy, <a href="t7g/map.html">the map page</a> makes it faster to navigate, you could just middle click every link. And here is <a href="t7g/help.html">the help page</a>.</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
<h1>For the T11H page, start <a href="t11h/open.html">with the t11h/open.html file</a></h1>
<br/>
<h2>If you're lazy, <a href="t11h/map.html">the map page</a> makes it faster to navigate, you could just middle click every link. And here is <a href="t11h/help.html">the help page</a>.</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
There's more too!
