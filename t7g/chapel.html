<h3>
Buy the games online:<p><br>
</h3>
The best choice is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080113101054/http://www.amazon.com/" target="new">Amazon</a>, they sell both the games, or there is an auction that sells the game, or they give links to Amazon-linked online shops who do sell the game at that moment. 
Another option is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080113101054/http://www.cdaccess.com/" target="new">Cd Access</a>, at the time that I'm writing this they sell the 11th hour.<p><br>

<h3>
Buy the novel online:<p><br>
</h3>
There is a novel about the seventh guest. It is written by Matthew J. Costello (the original screenplay-writer) and Craig
Shaw Gardner. I read it and loved it, it really adds more to the game. You can buy this online at multiple sites. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080113101054/http://www.amazon.com/" target="new">Amazon</a> is present again. It costs 21,95 American dollars. Amazon also suggest other online shops, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080113101054/http://www.blackandread.com/books/fiction/horror.htm" target="new">Black and Read</a>, this store sells the book for only 11 American dollars. Amazon also links <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080113101054/http://www.booksbuyer.com/" target="new">Booksbuyer</a>, this shop sells it at the same price as Amazon.<p><br>
<h3>
Buy the strategyguide online:<p><br>
</h3>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080113101054/http://www.amazon.com/" target="new"> Amazon</a> is probably your best shot. Just type 'the 7th guest' in the search option on the openingspage and you will find it, if they offer it at that moment.<p><br>

<h3>
Buy the soundtrack online:<p><br>
</h3>
You guessed it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080113101054/http://www.amazon.com/" target="new"> Amazon</a> sells the cd '7/11' by the Fat Man. But you can also
buy it at his own site, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080113101054/http://www.fatman.com/" target="new">The Fat Man</a>.<p><br>
