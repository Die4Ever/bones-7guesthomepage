Wanted to know about the lyrics of the music of the 11th hour? Well,
here it is. All these songs can be found on the making of the 11th hour.<br>
Except Skeletons in my closet and The Game, those are on the audio part of the seventh guest.<br>
I also have a couple of midi's for your hearing pleasure.<br>

      Choir Pain<br>
        Mystere, fara, Astaroth!<br>
        Manitas, morto-ra<br>
        Hala, hala, Astaroth!<br>
        Hass! Hass!<br>

The Game <br>
Let's take the time,<br>
        To find out what's inside<br>
        Away from all this wind and rain<br>
        The six arrive, the fire lights <br>
        their eyes; Invited here to learn <br>
        to play - the game
        <p>We travel blind, and feel
        along the walls<br>
        And barely know from where we came,<br>
        The paths divide the players from the rules,<br>
        but we're the ones who chose to play - the game.Let's take the time to
        find ourselves again,<br>
        Away from daily stress and pain.<br>
        Though we may find, we'll not come back the same,<br>
        that happens sometimes when we play - the game</font></p>
        <p>Mr Death<br>
        I can't take a breath
        without seeing Mr Death.<br>
        Well, I can't take a step, I can't make a move,<br>
        I can't think a thought, I can't sing a song,<br>
        with a minimal groove.<br>
        I can't get away from the singular fact.<br>
        I can't take a breath without seeing Mr Death.</font></p>
        I can't take a bath; Mr
        Death is washing my back.<br>
        I can't do the disco; Mr Death will step on my foot.<br>
        I can't sing the rest; Well, I can't take a breath;<br>
        without seeing Mr Death. <br>
        <br>
        But I can't see Mr Death if I don't take that breath.(A one and a two and a
        three) 
        I can't find my car keys;<br>
        Better ask Mr Death. And I get so lonely;<br>
        We have a game of chess. 
        I can't take a breath
        without seeing Mr Death.<br><p>Skeletons
        in my Closet<br><p> Written
        by David Sanger<br>
        Produced by The Fat Man<br><p>
       Forty-eight years of
        livin',<br>
        an angel in disguise.<br>
        Forty-eight years of lovin',<br>
        smiling with my eyes.<br>
        Forty-eight years of memories,<br>
        neatly tucked away.<br>
        When daylight dies I hear them rise,<br>
        and dance upon their graves.<br>
        What's that sound comin' from the<br>
        dresser on a night as black as pitch?<br>
        What's that sound comin' from the<br>
        bureau do I dare turn on the switch?<br>
        Bones them bones, them dry bones all<br>
        bleached and deathly white.<br>
        I've got skeletons in my closet<br>
        and they're rattling tonight.</p>
        The cheat bone's connected
        to deceit bones<br>
        Are thereby connected to lies:<br>
        'I-love-you's said indescriminately<br>
        Make the sockets for the eyes.<br>
        The love bones knock against the hate bones,<br>
        And the fingers click in time.<br>
        Their won't be sleep for the weary tonight,<br>
        'Cos all those bones are mine.</p>
        (hup hup, they're in my
        closet now<br>
        hup hup hup, I wouldn't wanna wake 'em<br>
        hup hup, they're in my dresser drawer<br>
        hup hup hup, I'm trying to forsake 'em)<br>

        <b>The Joker</b> (commonly known as
        'The Final Hour')Written
        and Produced by The Fat Man<br><p>
Welcome to my, house.<br>
        Say what you want! Say it! Come (come) play the shell
        game with the madman,<br>
        (Mystere, fara, Astaroth!)<br>
        And maybe you can win his bride,<br>
        (Manitas, morto-ra)<br>
        Or you can try for something better.<br>
        You decide.
        <p>&lt;(let's take) <br>
        Why don't you bet it all on seven? <br>
        (the time)<br>
        Your guess could be as good as mine. <br>
        (to find out what's inside)<br>
        Just roll the bones: you could get lucky.<br>
        (away from all this wind and rain)<br>
        For a time....</font></p>
        I should be doing stuff,
        but I'd rather put it off;<br>
        Until the final hour. 
        <p>(answering machine
        message)<br>
        &quot;Hello you've reached the madman and me.<br>
        There's no one in the house right now,<br>
        But you know what to do....don't you?</font></p>
        <p><yes you can set your sights on heaven,<br>
        And there's no better time than now. <br>
        Everybody walks away a winner.<br>
        Don't ask how.</font></p>
        <p>Now that your luck has
        gotten colder,<br>
        Perhaps you'll tell me how it feels<br>
        to be the one who plays the joker;<br>
        ...making deals!</p>
        <p>I should be doing stuff,
        but I'd rather put it off;<br>
        Until the final hour.(repeat and fade) </font></p><br><p>
