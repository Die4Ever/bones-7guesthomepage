    <h2><a name="Endgame">Endgame</a></h2>
    
    <p>Go to doll house in Nursery (15 movements). Zoom in on kitchen floor.
    </p>
    
    <p>There is no Autoplay option with the Floor Game, so here is a strategy
      that works most of the time: </p>

<pre>
	You	Stauf

	 H        K
	 E        L
	 C        A or B (1)
	 J        M
	 G        F
	 N        I, removing your pieces at G &amp; H
	 G        H or D (2)
	 E        D
	 O

(1) You can win at move 17 if Stauf plays B
(2) If D, you can win by playing O
</pre>
    
    <p>If Stauf plays unexpectedly, restart the game or choose a new starting
      position. </p>
    
    <p>The endgame sequence begins after you win the Floor Game. No speedups
      with the right mouse button are possible for the rest of the game. First
      is a 7-minute sequence moving down the hall to Ham. Temple's room, pausing
      at each and every decision point. Then, you have a 38-second window (12
      strikes of the clock) to pick one of three doors, each of which results in
      a different final video sequence. Finally, you spend the next 5 minutes
      watching the <em>mandatory</em> game credits (no way to skip through
      these, short of rebooting). Once you get all the way through the credits,
      the final configuration file S11H.0 is created in your installation
      directory. When present, this file causes future plays of the game to have
      an Open House feature with which you can move around the house at will. If
      you rebooted during the credits.

    <p> 1.&gt; After the whole intro sequence (PG rating. Bastards.), you'll
      wind up in the Foyer. Look familiar? Head off to the right and go into the
      Library. Turn till you're facing the fireplace. Note there's a bottle
      there. Your first &quot;treasure hunt&quot; clue from the GameBook is &quot;Winter
      Coat Worn For A Mixer.&quot; Well, &quot;Winter Coat&quot; is actually an
      anagram for &quot;Tonic Water.&quot; So grab the bottle of tonic water.
      You get a new, short video sequence. Now, since you're here, walk over to
      the bookshelf. Note you get the pulsing brain icon when you sweep the
      cursor across that area. Click on it, and you'll see a row of eight books.
      The object is to put all the green books on the left, and all the red
      books on the right. You can only move adjacent pairs, and it has to be
      done in four moves. So, if the books are set up like this:</p>
    
    <p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</p>
    
    <p>Click on the line between 2&amp;3 (they'll move to slots &quot;9&amp;10&quot;
      on the right) Then click on the line between 5&amp;6 (they'll move to the
      now open 2&amp;3 slot) Then click on the line between 8&amp;9, to move
      those to the now open 5&amp;6. Finally, click on 1&amp;2 to move them to
      slots 8&amp;9. Puzzle solved, Library done. </p>
    
    <p>2.&gt; Exit the library and go upstairs. Using the GameBook's map,
      you'll note that Brian Dutton's room is now open. Go in. You'll note that
      your next clue is &quot;Rolling rock, bottle cap.&quot; Bottle cap...and
      rock is an anagram of &quot;cork.&quot; You need a cork. On the floor to
      the left of the old television, there's an overturned, empty bottle of
      champagne. Grab the cork. This'll open the Picture Gallery. There's also a
      cash register in Dutton's room, and it's a puzzle. The idea is to get each
      half of the register display to show the same amount. The amount needed in
      each half is 81 cents. So, if the keys are set up like this:</p>
    
    <p>5 5 1 25 5 5 10 10</p>
    
    <p>5 25 10 25 10 10 1 10</p>
    
    <p>Press the left five keys in the top row, and then the left three keys in
      the bottom row. That's all there is to that one. Alternately, you can
      press the entire top row of keys, and then the leftmost and rightmost keys
      on the bottom row...that'll work, too. There are at least two other
      solutions, but hey, this a walkthrough, not a &quot;gimme every
      possibility in the world&quot; guide.</p>
    
    <p>3.&gt; Check your GameBook again. You wind up with &quot;Artsy, excited
      lecher.&quot; Anagram time again. Artsy is an anagram of &quot;satyr.&quot;
      Ya gotta find a satyr. (don't even try to tell me you don't know what that
      is). Go back down to the Foyer, and check the table to the left of the
      staircase. You'll see there's a section of chessboard on it. Fans of The
      7th Guest know what this means...a pain in the ass. Anyway, the object of
      this puzzle in this one is to reverse the positions of the knights; you
      can't move a knight off the chessboard, either, which is a bit strange.
      This is not all that simple. Even the GameBook hint thingy says it takes
      40 moves. So, here's the 40 move solution. If the board is set up like
      this</p>
    
    <p>1 </p>
    
    <p>2 3 4 5 </p>
    
    <p>6 7 8 </p>
    
    <p>9 10</p>
    
    <p>Then, follow this move sequence: Knight at 1 to 4, then to 10, then to
      2, then to 8. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 7 to 1, then to 4, then to 10, then to 2. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 5 to 7, then to 1, then to 4, then to 10. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 6 to 4, then to 1, then to 7, then to 5. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 10 to 4, then to 1, then to 7. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 2 to 10, then to 4, then to 1. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 8 to 2, then to 10, then to 4, then to 6. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 1 to 4, then to 10, then to 2. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 7 to 1, then to 4, then to 10. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 6 to 4, then to 1, then to 7. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 10 to 4, then to 1. </p>
    
    <p>Knight at 2 to 10, then to 4, then to 6. 40 moves, puzzle solved.
      Next...</p>
    
    <p>4.&gt; Well, you've still got to find that satyr. Check the clock by the
      chessboard. Check the bottom section with the unmoving pendulum. It's a
      secret passage to the Portrait Gallery. Wander around until you find a
      painting with a fallen statue piece (a body section) under it. Look at the
      painting above it...a nude woman figure struggling with, you guessed it, a
      satyr. Click on the satyr for another video sequence. Note: Don't do the
      puzzle in this room yet; it triggers the end of the &quot;7 P.M.&quot;
      hour when you solve it. Check the GameBook for your next clue...&quot;A
      Heart Attack Could Put You In The Ground.&quot; </p>
    
    <p>5.&gt; No problem. Heart is an anagram for &quot;Earth,&quot; and &quot;ground&quot;
      is another hint to that. There's a globe in the Library. Go back to the
      library and touch the globe. You'll get another video sequence. Now, the
      Game Book says you want &quot;BattleGround.&quot; Wonderful. ANOTHER
      anagram. &quot;Battle&quot; is an anagram for &quot;Tablet.&quot; The
      tablet you want is in a room that isn't open yet. Go back up to Dutton's
      room, and click on the closet door (it's a bit tricky to get there, but
      you'll make it eventually). This takes you to the Chapel. Go through here
      to the arched doorway in the back, and go through into the Lab. Head to
      the puzzle on the cabinet. This one's an Artifical Intelligence game.
      You've got to get the mouse to go into the orange hole. Placing a maze
      piece in a row causes the other pieces in the row to slide over, or
      placing one in a column causes the column to slide up or down. Worse yet,
      you can't put a piece at a row that Stauf played on the last turn. After
      you place a piece, you can move the mouse to any location along the newly
      created path. As this is an AI game, you'll find this is incredibly
      frustrating, and there is no set solution. My best recommendation is
      actually to let Samantha beat him (that is, keep whacking the Help key on
      the GameBook till she solves the puzzle). The manual says &quot;overuse of
      the Help feature may weaken the connection between your helper and you.&quot;
      Yeah, right. Just like the book in the Library in the 7th Guest, if
      overused, would make it impossible to win. Wrong answer, folks. So, if you
      really want to play, be my guest...there is no real winning strategy, just
      a lot of luck. I suggest you just let Samantha beat it. NOW, look at the
      green bottle next to the puzzle. There's an asprin...or something...tablet
      next to it. Click on it, to get another video sequence. And another
      annoying clue...&quot;Bars Deter Cuckoo Bird.&quot; Well, &quot;bars deter&quot;
      is an anagram of &quot;redbreast.&quot; A robin. Head through the arched
      doorway with the levers &amp; gears &amp; stuff, through the crypt (ewwww)
      and you'll wind up in Temple's Bedroom. Go out of there, and head back to
      the Foyer. Go find the clock again, and this time, look around the area.
      You'll find a crooked picture of some birds in a tree. Click on the bird
      in the lower right corner...it's a robin. Touch it, and you'll get a
      sequence with Robin in the painting. The Game Book will beep, and you'll
      get a neat sequence with a tentacle</p>
    
    <p>6.&gt; Now the GameBook beeps again. &quot;Modern Art Flourishes Under
      The Sun.&quot; Well, that's an indication to go solve that painting puzzle
      back in the portrait gallery again...modern art under a picture of a girl
      in a dress, standing next to a giant sunflower. So head through the clock
      (how fortunate, you're right there as it is) and click on the Mondarin
      painting. This is another Artifical Intelligence game (there's a total of
      seven...sort of...in the game. Samantha can beat six of 'em). The object
      is to choose the last possible space, and you can't choose a space that is
      adjacent to a previously chosen space. When you choose a space, all the
      spaces touching it brighten, and when Stauf chooses one, all the pieces
      around it grey out. As it's an AI game, there's no set solution, but
      here's a good hint: there are two spaces you can choose to start with to
      have any real chance of winning. These are the vertical rectangle to the
      right of the center of the painting (that is, to the left of the two big
      vertical rectangles on the right side of the painting), or the &quot;L&quot;
      shaped piece at the bottom of the painting in the middle (just above the
      long horizontal rectangle along the bottom). The game should be over in
      about five moves. Always remeber to start with one of those two moves, and
      you might be able to pull off a win. If you get frustrated, Samantha can
      beat it. Winning this one signals the end of the 7 P.M. hour, gives you a
      good long ending sequence for the first part, and starts up the 8 P.M.
      hour. It's gonna get worse, folks...</p>
    
    <p>7.&gt; You start off 8 P.M. with another treasure hunt thing...&quot;SkedAddled.&quot;
      Another anagram, this time...&quot;Desk.&quot; So you need a desk. No
      problem. There is a desk in the Library. Sheesh. You keep going back in
      there! Talk about annoying. So go click on the desk in the Library and you
      get another video sequence. Now you get another clue...&quot;Part of the
      body examined in the doctor's office.&quot; Doesn't seem like much of a
      hint, unless you think the clue is in &quot;the doctor's office.&quot;
      Look closely and you find &quot;torso&quot; in there. (last four letters
      of &quot;doctor's&quot; and first letter of &quot;office.&quot;) So you
      need a torso. There was one under the picture of the satyr in the Portrait
      Gallery. Sigh. Go back there and click on the torso on the floor for yet
      another video sequence, and yet another clue. &quot;Libation for an
      affectionate puppy called Sounder.&quot; Weird clue, but consider...what
      does an affectionate puppy do? Lick people. Lick 'er. Liquor. Bad joke,
      but it's the clue you want. (The &quot;Sounder&quot; bit is a clue that
      the words sound like each other) Go back to Dutton's room again, and click
      on the champagne bottle (which you got the cork from before). How
      annoying. Guess what. Another video sequence, and another clue...&quot;Animal
      sullied street.&quot; Well, now...Animal. Obvious clue, and &quot;sullied&quot;
      means messed up...it's &quot;street&quot; that's messed up. Yep. Street is
      an anagram for &quot;setter.&quot; An Irish setter. Well, ya gotta go find
      an Irish Setter.</p>
    
    <p>8.&gt; Head upstairs and go into the Game Room. There's a puzzle you've
      got to solve on the pool table...the white balls must be changed into the
      first nine pool balls, in the proper order. Click on a ball, it turns to
      the number 1 ball. There's only one way you can do it, though, (Stauf's
      rules) so they can only be done in a certain order. Even though it's on an
      angle, look at it as a skewed square. Do it in this order</p>
    
    <p>7 8 9 </p>
    
    <p>6 4 1 </p>
    
    <p>5 2 3</p>
    
    <p>Once you're all set with that, look around for the picture of the dogs
      playing poker. One of the dogs is an Irish Setter. Touch it, and the
      GameBook gives you a video sequence with an interview between Robin and a
      doctor...Eileen's doctor. Including a flashback scene of Eileen's hand
      sliced off at the wrist...yay! Blood and gore! Plus, you get another clue
      (what a bargain!)</p>
    
    <p>9.&gt; Of course, it's completely messed up...it's like the whole thing
      is in a code. Hope you're good at codebreaking. Okay, if you're not, let's
      just say it's a pain. One of the GameBook clues is &quot;Xma'r translates
      to you'd&quot; Big help. I suppose you could figure it out from that, but
      if you don't want to...&quot;Read my face, but do not watch. I have hands
      with which to count, but have no crotch. I have no legs and yet I run. If
      we were related, you'd be the son of my son.&quot; Son of the
      son...grandson. So this'd be the grandfather...clock. Yep. Back to the
      foyer. Touch the clock pendulum and you'll get...not a video sequence on
      the GameBook, but a scene in which you encounter a ghost, or a reflection
      of a younger Eileen...who's looking for her friend, Samantha. Oh yeah, and
      you get another clue. It's another bunch o'gibberish. However, this one is
      set up so that it looks like the entire message is in English, just
      shifted one key to the right on a typewriter keyboard. These wrap, by the
      way based on the GameBook's keyboard, so...the first letter &quot;Z,&quot;
      is really &quot;M&quot; shifted one to the right. So, if you don't feel
      like puzzling through it, the message is &quot;My first is not bent
      around. My second means lift her up or cut her to the ground.&quot; Not
      bent is &quot;straight,&quot; and the second word...lift her up or cut her
      to the ground. &quot;Raise Her&quot; or &quot;Raze Her.&quot; Cute. You
      want a straight razor. It's upstairs, in the bathroom.</p>
    
    <p>10.&gt; So, head up to the bathroom Go ahead. Look in the tub. Cool!
      Full o' blood, with a skeleton in it! Look to the right of the tub on the
      floor, and click on the drain. It's another puzzle. You've got to swap the
      positions of the brown spiders on the top with those of the white spiders
      on the bottom. You can only move along straight lines from one point to
      the next. It must be done in seven moves, and a move is complete when
      another spider is selected (loosely translated, you don't have to move a
      selected spider just ONCE). So...if the thing is set up sorta like this</p>
    
    <p>2 </p>
    
    <p>1 3 </p>
    
    <p>4 5 </p>
    
    <p>6 8</p>
    
    <p>7 </p>
    
    <p>Then move in this order:</p>
    
    <p>#1: Select 1, move to 5. </p>
    
    <p>#2: Select 3, move to 7, then move to 1 </p>
    
    <p>#3: Select 8, move to 4, then to 7 </p>
    
    <p>#4: Select 6, move to 2, then to 8, then to 4, then to 3 </p>
    
    <p>#5: Select 5, move to 6, then to 2, then to 8. </p>
    
    <p>#6: Select 1, move to 5, then to 6. </p>
    
    <p>#7: Select 7 and move it to 1. That's it.</p>
    
    <p>No problem. Now pick up the straight razor on the edge of the bathtub.
      Wonderful scene with Marie and Chuck. Fun chick. And another clue...&quot;Fruit
      Loop On Stove.&quot; Here's the clue broken down...it's a fruit, and it
      has to do with a loop on a stove. A loop is a ring, or an &quot;O,&quot;
      and another word for stove is &quot;range.&quot; So &quot;O-range.&quot;
      Go to the Dining Room, and touch the orange in the still life picture. It
      animates with a truly sick scene, and then you get another video sequence,
      this time with &quot;Dreams abound of arming the rebels. What of nocturnal
      horses' schedules?&quot; The clue not only tells you where the next thing
      is, it also tells you what it is</p>
    
    <p>11.&gt; &quot;Arming the&quot; is an anagram for &quot;Nightmare,&quot;
      and &quot;nocturnal horse&quot; should probably clue you in to that one
      too. As for rebels...well, there's a room with a Confederate flag in it.
      That's in Ed Knox's room. Once you're in there, there's an old mirror. You
      have to slide the panes around in the mirror to restore it to its original
      state. You have to use the desilvering portions as your guide. The fact
      that your flashlight beam is always reflected in it does NOT help matters
      much. The biggest problem with this game is that 50% of the time, it's in
      a configuration that CANNOT be solved. The GameBook also suggests you use
      the desilvering sections of the mirror as clues to the solution. When it
      can be solved, you want to proceed from left to right, solving one column
      at a time. This is a big pain. While you can eventually beat the puzzle
      yourself if you keep resetting and trying again, it's okay to let Samantha
      beat this one, as there is no REAL strategy. The fact it can only be
      solved half the time makes me call it an AI game, even though it really
      isn't (that's why I call it the &quot;sort of&quot; seventh AI game). Just
      remember...if you want to beat it yourself, always start by getting the
      left column done first, and from then on, consider that section
      frozen...then move to the next column and try to solve that, then keep
      that frozen, etc. The panes should wind up set up as follows (one of these
      will be missing):</p>
    
    <p>1 2 3 4 5 </p>
    
    <p>6 7 8 9 10</p>
    
    <p>Where: </p>
    
    <p>Pane 1 has two desilvering portions; a larger, semi-elliptical one up
      the top, and a smaller semi-elliptical one on the right side of the pane
      halfway down.</p>
    
    <p>Pane 2 has a big section missing, with the portion along the left side
      still mostly intact, and some of the bottom still intact. </p>
    
    <p>Pane 3 has a majority of the pane missing, with only a little at the
      bottom left. </p>
    
    <p>Pane 4 also has a majority missing, with only a tiny bit in the lower
      left corner, and the upper right corner left. </p>
    
    <p>Pane 5 is mostly intact, save for a little desilvered section on the
      left side. </p>
    
    <p>Pane 6 is mostly intact, save for a little deslivered section midway up
      on the right side. </p>
    
    <p>Pane 7 has a thick, mostly horizontal deslivered section running just
      above center (with the right edge extending upwards to the top), and a
      tiny deslivered section on the right side down the bottom) </p>
    
    <p>Pane 8 has a mostly horizontal section at the top (obliterating the
      entire upper left corner), and a smaller patch in the lower right corner.
    </p>
    
    <p>Pane 9 has a horizontal patch that thins out as it runs left to right in
      the top section of the mirror, and a second patch obliterating a small
      section of the lower left corner. </p>
    
    <p>Pane 10 is intact.</p>
    
    <p>Terrible pain (I know, bad joke), especially since the missing pane is
      random every time. You might just want to let Samantha do this one if you
      get too frustrated, especially since you really don't know if you can beat
      the damn thing or not until you're almost finished! Anyway, whatever way
      you do manage to beat it, after you win, go over to the painting over the
      fireplace...fans of The 7th Guest will recall this is Fuseli's &quot;Nightmare.&quot;
      Touch the horse. Bingo. And a video sequence involving Robin and the
      police chief. Next clue comes up then...&quot;A distant, ancient Castle
      Keep, this famous Prince a place to sleep, To sleep, perchance to dream,
      of an upset teagarden indochine.&quot;</p>
    
    <p>12.&gt; After you finish going, &quot;HUH?&quot; you'll probably be
      really confused. However, Shakespeare fans will pick up the &quot;perchance
      to dream&quot; bit as something from one of his works, namely Hamlet.
      Plus, it mentions &quot;Prince,&quot; which should also clue you into
      Hamlet. But, it's not Hamlet you're looking for...anyone who's ever seen
      the parody of horror films called &quot;Student Bodies&quot; must remember
      this joke. Hamlet...is a danish prince. A Great Dane. And &quot;upset
      teagarden&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Great Dane.&quot; So you need a
      Great Dane. Sorry, the picture of the dogs playing poker in the Game Room
      doesn't have one. There is a faded picture of one in the Library (not
      AGAIN!) Go touch it, and you'll wind up with a verrrry interesting &quot;ghost&quot;
      sequence, including a bit with Marie in an impressive little costume, a
      Great Dane morphing into the hotel manager, and Marie herself morphing
      into an interesting monster. Fun chick. I like her. Then you get yet
      another clue...&quot;A man-horse on the fly sounds like a wounded bull's
      eye.&quot; Well, I wish I could say this wasn't a bad pun, but for those
      of you who like mythology...Bulls-eye. Hit the bullseye, you hit the
      center. Centaur, or man-horse. Bad pun. So you need to solve another
      puzzle...this one ends the 8 p.m. hour. Naturally, this means another AI
      game. Great. Actually, the &quot;on the fly&quot; also indicates the
      centaur is winged. This is a big mistake on the part of the game
      designers, actually. The actual puzzle is in the Chapel (through Dutton's
      room), and it's the weird sculpture with the triangle in the middle (the
      puzzle IS the triangle). The mistake is that this is NOT a centaur. Not
      even close. If it's anything, it's a winged Sphinx! The body shape is more
      accurate for a Sphinx, but I suppose it could count, as it's the only
      thing in the house even CLOSE to what you're supposed to be looking for.
      Click on the triangle</p>
    
    <p>13.&gt; The writer of this solution finds this puzzle hard, I disagree, the trick is to make a chain that touches all of the

borders.Start in the middle and make a chain with one empty space
between the cells, this way Stauf can't keep up.  You've got another big video sequence that shows you quite a bit
      more of what's happened. And the end of the 8 p.m. hour. Time to move on
      to 9...nope, it ain't over yet, folks. </p>
    
    <p>14.&gt; You start off the 9 p.m. hour with the clue &quot;put an olive
      in a stein, mix it up, and get the equivalent of a fool's London subway.&quot;
      Another word for fool is boob. A London subway is called a tube. &quot;Olive
      in a stein&quot; is an anagram of television...a boob tube. The TV is back
      in Dutton's room. Touch it, and you'll get a scene with Robin meeting
      Samantha...your helper in this game. And another clue. &quot;A vital,
      instrumental part.&quot; This is a bad joke, again. &quot;Instrumental&quot;
      indicates you want an instrument. And &quot;A vital part&quot; is...an
      organ. So go touch the organ back in the chapel. Great. You get an
      animation from the organ, and another clue from Stauf...&quot;22233642-736846873.&quot;
      Wonderful. Look at your phone, and match up letters with the numbers to
      figure out what the clue is. It actually reads &quot;Academic Penthouse.&quot;
      An academic penthouse is an Ivory Tower. Confused? Oh well. Anyway, what
      you want is up in the attic. Head upstairs and inside. You'll find a
      little train set. You've got to rearrange the letters attached to the
      engine so that it reads &quot;Stauf&quot; rather than &quot;Faust.&quot;
      Gee, I wonder if that's where the name came from. This one takes some
      time, and you've got to use the two switches to change around the letters.
      Start by clicking the left-hand switch, then move the letter &quot;A&quot;
      down and around until it ends up left of the &quot;F.&quot; Do the same
      with the &quot;U&quot; and the &quot;S.&quot; Then move the &quot;T,&quot;
      then the &quot;S,&quot; then the &quot;U,&quot; and then the &quot;A&quot;
      to the bottom track. Move the &quot;F&quot; to the far right of the top
      track. Now move the &quot;A&quot; to the top track to the left of the &quot;F.&quot;
      Move the &quot;U&quot; to the mid-point of the upper track, then the &quot;S&quot;
      to the left of the &quot;U,&quot; and the &quot;T&quot; to the left of the
      &quot;S.&quot; Move the &quot;A&quot; to the bottom track, followed by the
      &quot;T&quot; and the &quot;S&quot; (you should have &quot;STA&quot;) on
      the bottom track. Move the &quot;U&quot; to the left of the &quot;F.&quot;
      Now move the &quot;S&quot; from the bottom track to the mid-point of the
      upper track. Move the &quot;T&quot; from the bottom track to the left side
      of the &quot;S.&quot; Then move the &quot;A&quot; from the bottom track to
      the left side of the &quot;U.&quot; Move the &quot;T&quot; down and around
      the lower track so it's on the left side of the &quot;A.&quot; Then just
      push the &quot;S&quot; to the right against the &quot;T&quot; on the top
      track. So much for that... Now walk over to the chess table, and grab the
      only standing piece...a white rook, or white &quot;castle,&quot; or &quot;ivory
      tower.&quot; You meet another ghost...this one of a younger version of
      Samantha. And then you get another clue.</p>
    
    <p>15.&gt; This one comes up with &quot;Light piece from great orchestra.&quot;
      The answer is hidden in &quot;greaT ORCHestra.&quot; And it's a light
      piece. So you need a torch. There's one on the altar in the Chapel. Go
      touch it, and you get a scene with Chuck dropping off a dead body at the
      Mansion. Great. Well, now you get another clue...&quot;cheesy object that
      sounds larger.&quot; Larger...or greater. Cheese grater. That, of course,
      is in the kitchen. Go over to the butcher's block, and you'll find a
      series of eyeball plates arranged around a pentagram. This is another
      puzzle. The object is to create five stacks of two plates on every point
      of the star pattern. A plate must jump two plates, stacked or not. Once
      moved, a plate cannot be moved again. At least this one HAS a solution.
      Assume the plates are arranged like this: (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are the five
      star points) </p>
    
    <p>10 1 </p>
    
    <p>9 2 </p>
    
    <p>8 3 </p>
    
    <p>7 4 </p>
    
    <p>6 5</p>
    
    <p>Then, do the following. Move 8 to 1. Move 6 to 3. Move 10 to 5. Move 4
      to 7. Move 2 to 9. That's all there is to it. Now turn right and look at
      the stove. There's a bloody cheese grater there. Pick it up. COOL!
      Crawling, severed fingers! Nice effect! Then the GameBook beeps, and you
      get another clue.</p>
    
    <p>16.&gt; &quot;500=100=0&quot; Those of us who are mathematically
      inclined will say, &quot;boy, is THAT a dumb equation.&quot; Consider,
      though. 0 is a round object. 500 in Roman numerals is &quot;D,&quot; and
      100 in Roman numerals is &quot;C.&quot; So &quot;D=C=round object,&quot;
      or &quot;D is C is round object,&quot; or, if you will, &quot;DISC is
      round object.&quot; So you need a disc. Head up to the lab, and check out
      the small table next to the French door. A case for...believe it or not...&quot;The
      7th Guest.&quot; Good grief, talk about advertising! You get another short
      video clip. Then you wind up with another clue, &quot;Blend a teapot shot
      and the pearlies won't rot.&quot; Teapot shot is an anagram for &quot;Toothpaste.&quot;
      So go to the Bathroom (no, I mean WALK to the bathroom) and check the
      sink. Touch the toothpaste and it turns into a big green bug. Ick. Now the
      GameBook gives you yet another clue. &quot;Slyness holding shipment in
      choppe?&quot; Note that &quot;choppe&quot; is spelled in French style.
      Sly...can be &quot;guile,&quot; and a holding shipment is a &quot;lot.&quot;
      So, &quot;Guile lot in choppe.&quot; Guillotine. Head off to Hamilton
      Temple's room. You'll find a cube on the bookshelf in there, which is yet
      another puzzle. Click on it. Your mission is to get a path from one &quot;arrow&quot;
      face to the other. The trick here is that the number of pips aren't really
      numbers, they indicate direction. The direction you choose...defines the
      meaning of the die face from which you move. So, basically, let's say you
      start with a the four. Then you click on the one, to its right. From now
      on, whenever you click on a four face, the next move must be to the right.
      So, here's one solution (there's several). Start by clicking on the four
      above the first arrow. Then click on the three above it. (So four=&quot;up&quot;).
      Then click on the six above and to the right of the three (so three=&quot;up&amp;to
      the right&quot;). Then click on the one down and to the right of the six
      (so six=&quot;down&amp; to the right&quot;). Now click on the five to the
      right of the one (so one=&quot;right&quot;) Finally, click on the three
      below the five (so five=&quot;down&quot;) The puzzle will solve itself
      from there (because the three will send the path automatically up and to
      the right to another three, then up and to the right again to the one,
      which shifts it right to the three, which shifts it up and to the
      right...to the exit arrow). Now go touch the guillotine...it slices down,
      but doesn't get you. Then the GameBook has another vid sequence...this one
      of Eileen's hand getting caught in the Mansion gate and...well, you don't
      need to know the details, do you? Anyway, you'll get another clue then...&quot;Poor
      drainage could still produce a flower.&quot;</p>
    
    <p>17.&gt; &quot;Drainage&quot; is another anagram...for &quot;Gardenia.&quot;
      Go to the top of the stairs and look at the painting...yep. The big white
      flower on the left at the bottom is a gardenia. Click it. Nothing seems to
      happen, but you'll get a message as you start to walk off. After a while,
      the GameBook beeps again, with another clue...&quot;Sounds like it got
      higher from wine.&quot; Got higher...it &quot;rose.&quot; Rose wine. But
      what you need is a rose, the flower. Go to Martine Burden's bedroom. Go to
      the table with the pyramid on it...it's another puzzle. For this one, you
      have to click on letters. You must reveal two fifteen letter words, and
      once a letter has been chosen, you may not pass through that letter's
      space again. The outer corridor will always remain open. After you do the
      first word, different letters reappear to let you get the second word.
      Okay, the words you want are &quot;UNINTENTIONALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD,&quot;
      so here is the order to click on the letters in:</p>
    
    <p>(First word):</p>
    
    <p>13 4 6 3 7 12 14 8 11 5 15 9 10 2 1</p>
    
    <p>(Second word):</p>
    
    <p>11 5 12 4 6 1 14 7 2 10 13 15 8 3 9</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, once you finish, go over to the vanity...and there's a rose in a
      vase on it. Click on it, and a petal will fall off. You turn around and
      run into...Martine Burden. Well, this is an interesting little scene...and
      she just fades out afterwards. Sorry, folks. I always thought she was a
      serious babe anyway. Then the GameBook beeps again. Check it, for another
      clue (big surprise).</p>
    
    <p>18.&gt; &quot;What kind of jewelry is angrier?&quot; Well, well, another
      anagram. &quot;Angrier&quot; is &quot;earring.&quot; So head off to Julia
      Heine's room. Go for the jewelry box. There's another puzzle, this one in
      the pendant. The rules are simple: Each gem must be adjacent to a gem of a
      matching color. You can rotate a cluster of gems or swap positions with
      another cluster. So, here's a solution. If the pendant is set up like
      this:</p>
    
    <p>1 </p>
    
    <p>6 2 </p>
    
    <p>5 3 </p>
    
    <p>4</p>
    
    <p>Then, swap 3 and 4. Swap 3 and 6. Swap 3 and 5. Then turn 6 twice, 5
      twice, 4 five times, 3 four times, and 2 twice. That'll do it. Next, go
      over to the vanity and pick up the earring. You'll get a sick little
      sequence with a ripped-off ear bleeding rather profusely. Nice. Then,
      guess what, the game book beeps again. This one comes up with &quot;You
      might hear a well-mannered Cockney with a 60's hairstyle.&quot;
      Well-mannered could mean how someone behaves...and a Cockney accent would
      make that how someone &quot;behoives,&quot; and a 60's hairstyle is...a
      beehive. So you need a beehive. Go back up to the Attic and click on the
      door past the staircase (you know, where ya finally beat Stauf in the 7th
      Guest?).</p>
    
    <p>19.&gt; Up here is a blasted-out room. And a little beehive honeycomb on
      the floor, which winds up with blood and honey in it. This is another AI
      puzzle, and doubtless, fans of the 7th Guest will recognize this as the
      goddamn cell game from that one, except this time, Stauf has the blood and
      you have the honey. Globules divide into two when moved to an adjacent
      cell, and jumping two cells moves the globule without replicating. Honey
      absorbs adjacent cells filled with blood, and vice versa. Listen up,
      folks. Stauf responds in the same way you hit him. Be aggressive, and he
      does the same. Play defensively, and he does the same. There are 60 cells
      total, and you need 31 to win. So, it's even WORSE than the lab puzzle
      from 7th Guest. There is no set strategy, and it is a MAJOR pain in the
      ass. So, to be simple, once you get frustrated, just let Samantha do
      it...hell, it might even take HER a couple tries, but eventually, she will
      beat Stauf if you just keep punching the button. When you finally beat it,
      you'll get a long video sequence, which shows a LOT of info about what's
      been going on here...and an interesting thought. The house is alive, an
      alien creature. It raped both Eileen and Samantha. Samantha had an
      abortion, which left her paralyzed, but Eileen gave birth to Marie...a
      daughter of the house itself. Eww. I don't even want to think about that
      one for too long. Anyway, that triggers the end of the 9 p.m. hour and the
      start of the 10 p.m. hour.</p>
    
    <p>20.&gt; You start off with a clue...big surprise...&quot;Instrument is
      sharp, but missing its head.&quot; Well, it's an instrument. And it's &quot;sharp,&quot;
      but missing its head...the first letter. So you get &quot;harp.&quot;
      That's in the music room, way downstairs. Great. Head down there, and
      you'll find that the piano is blocking the harp. On the mantle is a small
      game with all sorts of furniture, and a piano. The idea is to move the
      pieces around until you can move the piano off the board. This one is
      ROUGH. Anyway, figure the pieces are arranged like this initially: </p>
    
    <p>1 (lounge) 10 (piano) 2 (lounge) </p>
    
    <p>6(chair) 7(chair) 8(chair) 9(chair)</p>
    
    <p>4(lounge) 3 (table) 5 (lounge) </p>
    
    <p>(It's tricky to look at it like that, but consider it as on an angle.
      You only have two squares open, those to the &quot;south of,&quot; or &quot;down
      from&quot; the endtable.)</p>
    
    <p>3 towards the right side of the board, 7 towards the right side of the
      board, 7 away from you, 6 away from you, 6 towards the right side of the
      board, 4 towards the left side of the board, 3 towards you, 7 towards the
      right side of the board, 6 away from you, 4 away from you, 1 towards the
      right side of the board, 1 towards the right side of the board, 10 towards
      you, 8 towards the left side of the board, 8 towards the left side of the
      board, 6 towards the left side of the board, 6 towards the left side of
      the board, 7 towards the left side of the board, 7 towards the left side
      of the board, 5 towards you, 9 towards the right side of the board, 9
      towards the right side of the board, 2 towards the right side of the
      board, 2 towards the right side of the board, 8 away from you, 6 away from
      you, 10 away from you, 1 towards the left side of the board, 1 towards the
      left side of the board, 4 towards you, 7 towards you, 7 towards the right 
      side of the board, 10 towards the right side of the board, 8 towards you,
      8 towards you, 6 towards the left side of the board, 6 towards you, 2
      towards the left side of the board, 2 towards the left side of the board,
      9 towards the left side of the board, 9 towards the left side of the
      board, 5 away from you, 7 away from you, 7 towards the right side of the
      board, 10 towards the right side of the board, 8 towards the right side of
      the board, 8 away from you, 1 away from you, 4 towards the left side of
      the board, 4 towards the left side of the board, 10 towards you, 9 towards
      you, 9 towards the right side of the board, 5 towards the left side of the
      board, 7 away from you, 9 towards the right side of the board, 10 away
      from you, 4 towards the right side of the board, 4 towards the right side
      of the board, 1 towards you, 6 towards you, 8 towards you, 2 towards you,
      5 towards the left side of the board, 5 towards the left side of the 
      board, 10 away from you, 8 towards the right side of the board, 8 towards
      the right side of the board, 6 towards the right side of the board, 6
      towards the right side of the board, 1 away from you, 4 towards the left
      side of the board, 4 towards the left side of the board, 8 towards you, 8
      towards the left side of the board, 3 towards the left side of the board,
      9 towards you, 9 towards you, 7 towards you, 7 towards you, 10 towards the
      right side of the board, 6 away from you, 6 away from you, 8 away from
      you, 8 away from you, 3 towards the left side of the board, 7 towards the
      left side of the board, 7 towards you, 10 towards you, 10 towards the
      right side of the board. 90 moves, and the piano is off the board.</p>
    
    <p>ALL RIGHT! Turn around, and note...the piano is now gone. You can go
      touch the harp. Then the GameBook beeps with another clue. This begins a
      good string of stuff without a puzzle.</p>
    
    <p>21.&gt; &quot;A defective truck with a crane makes for a ball-busting
      ballet.&quot; Truck and crane is an anagram for &quot;nutcracker,&quot;
      but for a good laugh, hit the Help key three times to hear Samantha get a
      bit embarressed by the clue she gives out. Go upstairs to the hallway and
      touch the nutcracker on the floor in the corner down at the far right end
      of the hall. It animates for a minute, then you get another video
      sequence...with Marie and Chuck. Then you get another clue...&quot;Look at
      key missing first misprinted label.&quot; Key missing first...is ey. Then
      rearrange the letters in label to get eball, and you get...eyeball. The &quot;look
      at&quot; is also a clue. Go into the Game Room and click on the little cue
      ball, painted like an eyeball. It spins around, with cut nerves and
      blood...ick. Then you get ANOTHER clue...&quot;Disabled cutting edge.&quot;
      Hell with it. Without explanation, you find &quot;blade&quot; inside &quot;Disabled,&quot;
      which also reflects the &quot;cutting edge&quot; bit. So you want a blade.
      Go into Temple's bedroom and click on the hunting knife in the headboard
      of the bed. You get another video, this one with Chuck
      stabbing...something. Great. Just what you needed to see. Then you get
      another clue, one of my favorites...&quot;Unreasonable reason.&quot;
      Unreasonable can mean crazy. A reason for doing something is your motive.
      So crazy motive... or loco motive. Go to the attic and touch the toy
      train. A neat little sequence follows, and then you get yet another clue.
      &quot;Paper used in unusual theses.&quot; Theses mixed up is &quot;sheets.&quot;
      Go to Martine Burden's room and touch the bloody part of the bedsheet to
      get another video sequence...this one with Chuck getting pulled into the
      house with a bloody corpse. Then you get another clue...&quot;Adriot
      holding a sharp instrument.&quot; Well, this time it's a different blade.
      Adroit means &quot;clever.&quot; So the clue is actually &quot;Clever
      holding 'A'...sharp instrument,&quot; or &quot;Cleaver.&quot; Go to the
      kitchen and grab the meat cleaver embedded in the door. Then you get a
      wonderful scene with Julia Heine (looking younger than before), Chuck, and
      Stauf...and Chuck finally gets the cleaver in the head. YAAAYYY!!! Of
      course, then you get another clue from the GameBook. This one is &quot;A
      desserted Arthropod.&quot; An Arthropod is a type of crustacean. And it's
      a dessert. Go to the Dining Room, and note the cake shaped like
      a...yep...a Trilobyte. That's the AI puzzle for the end of the 10 p.m.
      hour.</p>
    
    <p>22.&gt; When you click on it, you wind up in a game of Connect Four,
      with bonbons. You're playing against Stauf. The whole mission is to get
      four of your bonbons connected in a row, four connected in a column, or
      four connected in a diagonal before Stauf does. THIS time, however, I
      happen to have a winning strategy, but it all depends on Stauf's first
      move. There are eight available columns, as follows:</p>
    
    <p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</p>
    
    <p>Always start in column 3 or column 6. If you start in column 3 and Stauf
      then opens with column 5, you've got him. If you start in column 6 and he
      opens with column 4, you've got him. Otherwise, I'd suggest you just reset
      the puzzle...or play him, if you want the fun. Anyway, let's say you get
      the first situation (you pick 3 and he takes 5). Play in this order, using
      the columns above as a guide (the odd-numbered moves are yours):</p>
    
    <p>6 </p>
    
    <p>4 8 </p>
    
    <p>3 7 10 </p>
    
    <p>9 11 1 5 2</p>
    
    <p>In that one, you win on the 11th move. Now, let's say the other
      situation happens; you start in 6 and he takes 4. Play in this order,
      using the columns above as a guide (once again, the odd-numbered moves are
      yours):</p>
    
    <p>11 </p>
    
    <p>10 </p>
    
    <p>14 8 </p>
    
    <p>12 4 </p>
    
    <p>5 3 </p>
    
    <p>6 7 2 15 1 9 13</p>
    
    <p>You can win this one fairly easily (oh yeah?- Bones). Then you get another long
      sequence...Chuck stabbed the chief (who'd apparently been sleeping with
      Robin) instead of Robin...so he got the axe. Or the cleaver, in this case.
      And so on, up into showing Robin entering the house...and the beginning of
      the eleventh hour. 11 p.m.</p>
    
    <p>23.&gt; Once again, we start off with a clue. &quot;663 264625 46 2
      6455466.&quot; Another telephone message, and this one says &quot;one
      animal in a million.&quot; Is tere an animal in &quot;million?&quot; Yup.
      A lion. There's a lion sculpture at the top of the stairs. Go up and touch
      it. You'll see a scene in which Robin is attacked by a cougar. She and her
      sister drowned a kitten when they were young, apparently. Hmmph. Bitch
      deserves to die(she didn't ment it- Bones), after all. Anyway, you then get another clue. &quot;Drink
      left at sea.&quot; Well, left at sea is &quot;port.&quot; Port wine is a
      drink. Head to the Knox's bedroom and click on the wine glass on the table
      next to the bed. Edward Knox appears, tries to warn you, and then his head
      blows up. COOL! Then you get another clue...&quot;Snake, baby, trap.&quot;
      These are all words that are associated with &quot;rattle.&quot; So go to
      the Doll Room. On the bureau is a wooden puzzle with tinker toys and chess
      bishops on it. This is another puzzle. You have to interchange the white
      bishops on one side with the black bishops on the other. You can move any
      piece in any order, but it must move along a straight line, and cannot
      land in line with a bishop of the opposite color. Okay, set the &quot;board&quot;
      up like this:</p>
    
    <p>4 8 </p>
    
    <p>2 6 10 </p>
    
    <p>3 7 </p>
    
    <p>1 5 9</p>
    
    <p>Where the white bishops start on positions 9 and 10, and the black
      bishops start on positions 1 and 2. Move 10 to 7. Move 1 to 8. Move 2 to
      3. Move 7 to 4. Move 3 to 5. Move 8 to 10. Move 9 to 6. Move 6 to 1. Move
      4 to 6. Move 5 to 2. Move 10 to 5. Move 6 to 8. Move 5 to 7. Move 2 to 4.
      Move 8 to 3. Move 7 to 10. Move 4 to 9. And move 3 to 2 to win. To the
      left of the bureau, check the floorboards to find a trapdoor...a passage
      to the nursery. Search around there, and you'll find the rattle. Then
      you'll get a scene in the nursery...in which Stauf offers Robin money,
      power, and all that wonderful kind of stuff. Then the video ends...and you
      get another clue.</p>
    
    <p>24.&gt; &quot;A letter from Greece is quite a number in Rome.&quot;
      Those of you who know the Greek alphabet, raise your hands. Okay, one
      Greek letter is XI, which is...guess what...eleven in Roman numerals. Go
      back to the grandfather clock and click on the eleven on the clock face.
      You get a long video in which...well, we find out, sort of, what happened
      to Robin. Sort of. Then you talk to Samantha again, who tells you to get
      out now...she says you can't win. Not what you wanted to hear. Then the
      GameBook beeps again with another clue...&quot;This eight letter word has &quot;K-S-T&quot;
      in the middle, in the beginning, and at the end.&quot; But that would be
      nine letters just for the KSTKSTKST. Stupid sounding, but it's another
      trick. It has &quot;KST&quot; in the middle, &quot;IN&quot; the beginning,
      &quot;AND&quot; at the end. Or, &quot;INKSTAND.&quot; Head back to the
      Library (groan). When you click on the inkstand, the pen writes down &quot;Play
      in my doll house!&quot; Head back to the Doll Room, and click on the
      dollhouse. When you look inside, you'll find that there's a little puzzle
      on the floor. The Help button won't help you...Samantha says it's because
      the connection is getting weak. This is deliberate, not because of
      overusing the help feature. This is the last AI game, and you've got to
      beat it on your own. It is, in fact, the game of Pente, where the object
      is to get five of your pieces in a row, or capture five pairs of your 
      opponent's pieces. If you enclose a pair of opponent's pieces with two of
      your own, you will &quot;capture&quot; those pieces. The whole idea is to
      get an &quot;open four,&quot; or four connected piece of your color
      without one of Stauf's on either end of the line of four. Get one of
      those, and you've won, because you should be able to get five no matter
      what Stauf tries. Luckily, when you play this the first time, you get the
      first move...and Stauf plays rather half-heartedly. After all, he doesn't
      mind you beating this one, considering what you'll deal with next. If you
      go back and play again later, though, he'll play much harder, and if you 
      somehow manage to go back and do it a third time, he starts looking five
      moves ahead (nearly impossible to beat)(I did it, smirk!- Bones). Anyway, whenever you manage to
      beat him, you're on to the final challenge.</p>
    
    <p>25.&gt; You go on to a long video, in which you're the contestant in
      Stauf's game show. He opens up three doors, and you get to pick which one
      you want. Behind the left door is Marie, in full &quot;slut&quot; mode,
      offering herself up for you. In the middle is Samantha, in a TV set,
      logically asking you to choose her. Behind the right door is Robin, who
      you've been looking for the whole time anyway...and she tells you that she
      loves you.</p>
    
    <p>Okay, folks, it's decision time. Who do you pick? The lusty Marie?
      Helpful Samantha? Or your former girlfriend, Robin? Hmmm. Actually, I
      think it's pretty logical, but here's what happens for each one you
      choose:</p>
    
    <p>IF YOU PICK MARIE: Basically, you wind up back at a no-tell motel. You
      and she start to get it on...and then she turns into Stauf in a wig...who
      then reverts to his natural alien form and proceeds to eat you alive.
      Literally.</p>
    
    <p>IF YOU PICK ROBIN: Things seem great, as you go off together, and
      apparently get married. Then YOU are found murdered, and Robin is found to
      now be president of the brand-new Stauf broadcasting company. Guess
      Samantha was right, and she said Yes to Stauf after all.</p>
    
    <p>IF YOU PICK SAMANTHA: You have a little conversation with Samantha back
      at her house. Then you turn on the monitor...and Stauf's house burns to
      the ground. This, of course, is the ending you're &quot;supposed&quot; to
      pick in order to truly win the game. End of story!</p>
