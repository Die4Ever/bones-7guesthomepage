I don't know how old this website is, but it doesn't exist anymore. Luckily the Wayback Machine captured most of it (missing a bunch of images). Unfortunately the Wayback Machine is a little slow, so navigating around the house in this way is a bit of a pain, and the split screen isn't sized properly for modern screens.
<br/>
So I made this tweaked version that can be easily self-hosted or downloaded, and it runs much faster.

For the T7G page, start <a href="t7g/open.html">with the t7g/open.html file</a>
<br/>
If you're lazy, <a href="t7g/map.html">the map page</a> makes it faster to navigate, you could just middle click every link. And here is <a href="t7g/help.html">the help page</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
For the T11H page, start <a href="t11h/open.html">with the t11h/open.html file</a>
<br/>
If you're lazy, <a href="t11h/map.html">the map page</a> makes it faster to navigate, you could just middle click every link. And here is <a href="t11h/help.html">the help page</a>.

There's more too!
