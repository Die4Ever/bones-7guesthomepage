"Finding things a little cryptic?"
</h2>
I bet you're glad that I didn't make you go through the maze, now did ya! Hehehe.
This is where I live, here you can find a couple of fun fan bits. Just the pieces that I couldn't place anywhere else, but it would be a shame not to show them.<p><br> 
This is a little test to see if you are a the seventh guest addict. When all the lines
apply to you, you're an addict (and a bit of a looney, hehehe).
<center>
You know you're a seventh guest addict when:<br>
<p>
10. you stand in a hallway waiting for a woman in a white dress to appear.<br>
 9. you're waiting for the seventh guest to arrive through a window at your birthdayparty.<br>
 8. You yell at people "DON'T LOOK AT THAT PAINTING!".<br>
 7. you think Stauf's head is coming out your soup.<br>
 6. you don't want to look in a microscope, because it's too damn hard.<br>
 5. someone askes you something, you say "I remember...nothing."<br>
 4. you say "He was a drifter." everytime you open a book.<br>
 3. You're changing the positions of all the cans in the kitchen and then you say<br>
    "No, this isn't right."<br>
 2. you start humming a different tune when you enter another room.<br>
 1. you shout "COME BACK!" when somebody walks away.<br>

Letters

Below are several email's. Interesting stuff from fans and the creators of the seventh guest.<br>First up is the response from Robert Hirschboeck, the actor who played Henry Stauf, to this site.<p>
<center>
<h4><br>
My Dear Mr. Bones;<br><p>

I have only now had the pleasure of exploring your site; quite nice, though<br>
I am still victim to an arcane system (Mac Performa). It runs a Tad... slow<br>
for me. Still, so very nice and so much to See!<br>
My own site as you likely know is nolonger in service, but I do have a few<br>
tidbits; eg. The old Electronic Entertainment article (Nov.1995) and the<br>
older version written for a German Computer Mag that once adorned my site.<br>
Perhaps you might like to include it in some future update.(note from Bones: <br>
It can be found in the attic of the site) In anycase, it<br>
is a pleasure to know there are fans still out there and interested; it's<br>
gotten rather cold and moldy in these old ruins since the HOUSE burned<br>
down... and oh so Looonnnneeelllllly! I'm hungry, mmmmmm... for good<br>
company...a delicious guest or two for dinner, washed down with a good<br>
chianti. (as compatriot Hannibal Lecter might put it.)  In anycase, fear not<br>
contacting me... but then please do not spread my address all over the web.<br>
A few dinner guests are delightful, a multitude is for those who enjoy<br>
loaves and fishes (burb!); and I've always been something of a recluse!<br>
<p><br>
Sincerely<br>
<p><br>
Rob Hirschboeck<br>
"The Real Deal"<br><p>
</h4>
I answered his wonderful email and this is what I got back.<br><p>
<h4>
&gt;Thank you so much for your kind and bone chilling email.I will post the<br>
&gt;article as soon as I finish up the next update to the digital mansion.<br>
<p>
Ahhhh, My Dear Mr. Bones - (Paul)<br>
<p>
A pleasure to meat... ah, meet you. Sometimes I'm a difficult old guy to dig<br> 
up, and cantankerous besides. I'm pleased you enjoyed my moldy old article, <br>
and good to hear that there are writers out there carrying on the tradition; <br>
keep those young juices flowing...<br>
<p>
&gt;I would like to ask if it's okay to forward a couple of questions to you?<br>
<p>
I'd be glad to entertain forwarded questions and missives from guests; send<br>
them on. I'll try to respond in a timely manner, though I can sometimes be<br>
quite slovenly... papers, knickknacks, blood and dust everywhere, hard to<br>
retain good help with such fear of the soup pot... tsk, tsk... Besides which<br>
the Henry persona seems to be scattered at times in all sorts of cobwebby<br>
corners and can take a while to reassemble. Still, being so lovingly<br>
remembered increases my strength and brings me baaaaaaaackccckkkk!<br>
mmmmmmmmmm for the good old days. "The rack was in fashion, the plague was<br>
my passion, each day held a new joy in store...Was anybody Happy?!" ;-).<br>
<p>

&gt;I guess, that you still have a spell over us, since the house just doesn't<br>
let us go.&gt;<br>
<p>
The spell yes; it's part of the BARGAIN. The HOUSE has us all.<br><p>
<br>
Be Well.<br>
<p>
RH. FAUST.<br>

Isn't that the nicest madman you've ever met? A couple of days later he sent me a mail with a 
correspondence he had with another seventh guest fan called Branden. This is what they had to write.<p>
<br>

<h4>
Heya Rob!<br>
<br><p>
Well, the sites were VERY interesting I must say.  As a WebMaster student an <br>
interesting navigation concept, but very good information.  I didn't know <br>
that a 3rd possible game was being looked at and concept art work existed for <br>
it!  That was amazing.  With the advances in technology today, I would LOVE <br>
to see the team reunite and continue work on a final chapter that would blow <br>
the industry away as 7th did in its time.  Make it amazing.  Use the ever <br>
expanding DVD platform so the game as a whole could exist on one DVD disc.  <br>
Hell, give the FatMan a 30 piece orchestra.  Could you imagine a real <br>
orchestrated score with a 30 piece orchestra playing that erie intro tune.<br>  
Video so crystal clear!  HEY!  We can dream. :-)  Never say Never!  Best <br>
Wishes.<br><p>
<br>
Branden<br><p>
<p>
(reply from Robert)
Yup it would be fun to take another swing at it.  I have real doubts about <br>
getting the old team together, although as a mutual project (meaning I guess<br>
that we would get away from the corporate hirarchical approach that<br>
essentially screwed Trilobyte and convene as a group of artists interested<br>
in really puting together a piece for love first and then for profit)  The<br>
folks I would trust to talk to about a real sequel would be Matt Costello<br>
who wrote the first version, The FatMan George Sanger,<br>
and Rob Landeros - mostly cause he's been through all the lessons a man<br>
could go through with Tbyte, and underneath everything that went on is a good<br>
artist.  He and David Wheeler at Aftermath have been doing alot with DVD. If<br>
they could  approach a project equitably and perhaps permit imput from<br>
other artists as to what is good<br>
taste and good storytelling - as in get rid of the T&A; airbrush "Basic Instinct"<br>
fantasy sexuality that pervaded 11H as well as TLC in favor of a good creepy story<br>
that dealt with and was an extention of the questions posed by T7G but never<br>
addressed or built upon in 11H.  I question if another game format would<br>
satisfy today's market so saturated in gun barrel games - But, If the story was <br>
right and really engaged<br>
the player - eg. dealt with some real substance like the problem of evil inside<br>
the player...  Well the games could get pretty personal.  I'd love to see<br>
Stauf set free again in the world of the Web. It's time that a new artform really<br>
got generated by all this technical whoopla, but that is difficult when the<br>
tech geeks are more envolved with what they can create than with challenging<br>
what happens inside the mind of the "audience". <br>
<p>
I believe that the most interactive part of any artwork is what goes on in<br>
the imagination of the person addressing the artform; be that the reader or<br>
the player.  The trick is to set the "audience" free.  Look what is<br>
happening with the Harry Potter books; folks have discovered the thrills<br>
their own imaginations can bring them again. All the characters,<br>
associations, sets, emotions happen inside. It's hard to top a good read for<br>
real interactivity! What is not given to you is always more interesting then<br>
what is. Most of our current cultural entertainment is based on passivity.<br>
Even good sex has to do with what is suggested in the mind, whereas if you<br>
see it all from the get go, well, it's all pretty ludicrous really, compared<br>
say with what Gypse Rose Lee could do with a single glove or a strategically<br>
placed fan. You really don't want to see the Man behind the curtain; if you<br>
do it just destroys the magic happening in your brain.<br>
<p> 
Art is what is induced in the mind, not handed out wholesale.  What's that<br>
old Frank Zappa song:<br>
<p>
    "What's the ugliest part of your body?<br>
     Some say your nose; some say your toes<br>
    I think it's your Mind..."<br>
<p>
As "STAUF", that is really the question I wanted to get the player to<br>
consider... Just what are you willing to give up your self your soul your<br>
time and your creativity for? Yes, you the one sitting inside staring at a<br>
computer screen all day, while there is sun and grass and baseball outside,<br>
and making and doing real things in a real world. A toy isn't really any<br>
good unless you can create your own reality around it using your own<br>
imagination and creativity. Watch any 5 year old invent worlds with some<br>
stuffed doll. The doll itself is just the vehical for the story the kid<br>
makes up.  Now how can you do that in this medium? That's the challenge.<br>
<p>
Oops! a little off topic here, and in to tirade.<br>
<p>  
~  Getting Graeme on board again would take some doing and some monumental
fence mending. <br>
 ...I do like the idea of a philharmonic FatMan though, and so I believe
would George.<br>
<p>
Worth dreaming on...<br>
<p>
Rob<br><p>
</h4>
Worth dreaming on indeed. But the facts are opponents in the quest for the third game. Here is Rob Landeros
with some interesting information about the third game.<p><br>
<h4>
When I left Trilobyte, I sold off or traded in most of my stock in the <br>
company.  Trilobyte held the rights to T7G3.  When they went belly up, all<br>
that remains of Trilobyte is the name on a piece of paper which is owned by<br>
Graeme.  I and my agents have shopped the idea of T7G3 around to various<br>
publishers over the last year, but there has been little to no interest.<br>
Most of the time, they don't bother to explain why they turn it down, so it<br>
is a mystery to me why they wouldn't jump on the idea.<br><p>
<br>
I imagine Graeme has made some attempts at selling the rights also, but as<br>
far as I am aware, he has not attracted a buyer yet.  If I should ever get<br>
an interested party, I would have my lawyer contact Graeme and see if a<br>
licensing deal could be arranged.  I've got two or three design ideas that I<br>
could apply to the title.<br>
<p>
Rob "Don Roberto" Landeros<br>
http://www.aftermathmedia.com/<br>
"&gt;&gt;Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else."<br>
</h4>
But what about a movie? Stauf and the gang on the big screen? Rob Landeros gives the other of his two cents.<p><br>
<h4>
You are probably very accurate when you say it is highly unlikely that <br>
7th Guest will ever be made into a movie. However, stranger things <br>
have happened. Sometimes, with the passage of time, old cult classics are <br>
dredged up and find a new audience to go along with the nostalgic original fans.<br>
 <p>
Having seen The Haunting recently, I cannot but think that a movie version of <br>
the 7th Guest would have to be better than that piece of crap. Feel free to talk <br>
it up if you like.<br>
 <p>
Don Roberto<br><p>
</h4>
So the chance that we will see something new about the house is as big as a stampcollection of an ant. Instead, let's focus
our thoughts on the people who made the classics. Here is The Fat Man with a reply. I asked him why his Fan mail manager
is a 13 year old boy (Brian Larsen). This is what Fat had to say.<br><p>
<h4>
Since I was in grade school, my family has called me the Patron Saint of<br>
the Nerds!<br>
<p>
I sometimes find that I like to give people a lot of rope, even if it means<br>
risking something myself.  It seems like the right thing to do.<br>
<p>
Once, a kid called me up and wanted to see my studio.  I agreed, and then I<br>
even had to pick him up at the bus stop.  He had a job at a nearby hotel.<br>
Why did I agree to meet with him?  Why did I give him a job composing a few<br>
tunes for Nintendo?  I dunno.  He seemed kind of distracted, like Elvis<br>
watching TV.  But I was busy and he was in the right place at the right<br>
time.  He was pretty good at the Nintendo stuff.<br>
<p>
When I was asked to do Wing Commander, I was too busy, so I contracted him<br>
to do the battle music and the theme.  Little did I know that he had had a<br>
space movie theme in his head since High School.   Dave Govett's theme to<br>
Wing Commander revolutionized the industry.  He was the first member of<br>
Team Fat, and we worked happily together for 8 years.  <br>
<p>
I recently drove him and his friends to their Millenium party in my rolls<br>
(Perhaps this would be a good story..."How I Spent my Last Day on Earth").<br>
I was happy to serve a guy who was so good to me for so long.  <br>
<p>
Pardon the Evil Slang, but I said, "Dave, you was my nigger* for 8 years.<br>
I'se _proud_ to be _yo'_ nigger tonight!"<br>
<p>
*He wasn't.  We were partners.<br>
<p>
</h4>
Well, that's it. Now, wasn't that fun? Poking around in other people's mail!Hehehe, now please leave the crypt so I can have
my beautysleep, tah!
